  abstract = {Climate warming has been linked to an apparent general decrease in body sizes of ectotherms, both across and within taxa, especially in aquatic systems. Smaller body size in warmer geographical regions has also been widely observed. Since body size is a fundamental determinant of many biological attributes, climate-warming-related changes in size could ripple across multiple levels of ecological organization. Some recent studies have questioned the ubiquity of temperature\textendash size rules, however, and certain widespread and abundant taxa, such as diatoms, may be important exceptions. We tested the hypothesis that diatoms are smaller at warmer temperatures using a system of geothermally heated streams. There was no consistent relationship between size and temperature at either the population or community level. These field data provide important counterexamples to both James' and Bergmann's temperature\textendash size rules, respectively, undermining the widely held assumption that warming favours the small. This study provides compelling new evidence that diatoms are an important exception to temperature\textendash size rules for three reasons: (i) we use many more species than prior work; (ii) we examine both community and species levels of organization simultaneously; (iii) we work in a natural system with a wide temperature gradient but minimal variation in other factors, to achieve robust tests of hypotheses without relying on laboratory setups, which have limited realism. In addition, we show that interspecific effects were a bigger contributor to whole-community size differences, and are probably more ecologically important than more commonly studied intraspecific effects. These findings highlight the need for multispecies approaches in future studies of climate warming and body size.},

The model thus provides a synthetic, mechanistic framework for linking global biogeochemical cycles to cellular-, individual- and community-level processes.},

  abstract = {Understanding how animals interact with their environment is critical for evaluating, mitigating and coping with anthropogenic alteration of Earth's biosphere. Researchers have attempted to understand some aspects of these interactions by examining patterns in animal body mass distributions. Energetic, phylogenetic, biogeographical, textural discontinuity and community interaction hypotheses have been advanced to explain observed patterns. Energetic and textural discontinuity hypotheses focus upon the allometry of resource use. The community interaction hypothesis contends that biotic interactions within assemblages of species are of primary importance. Biogeographical and phylogenetic hypotheses focus on the role of constraints on the organization of communities. This paper examines and organizes these various propositions about species body mass distributions and discusses the multiple competing hypotheses, how their predictions vary, and possible methods by which the hypotheses can be distinguished and tested. Each of the hypotheses is partial, and explains some elements of pattern in body mass distributions. The scale of appropriate application, relevance and interpretation varies among the hypotheses, and the mechanisms underlying observed patterns are likely to be multicausal and vary with scale.},

  abstract = {Climate change is altering geographical ranges, population dynamics and phenologies of many organisms. For ectotherms, increased ambient temperatures frequently have direct consequences for metabolic rates, activity patterns and developmental rates. Consequently, in many insect species both an earlier beginning and prolongation of seasonal duration occurred in parallel with recent global warming. However, from an ecological and evolutionary perspective, the number of generations (voltinism) and investment into each generation may be even more important than seasonality, since an additional generation per unit time may accelerate population growth or adaptation. Using a dataset extending back to the mid-nineteenth century, I report changes in the voltinism of butterfly and moth species of Central Europe. A significant proportion of 263 multi-voltine species showed augmented frequency of second and subsequent generations relative to the first generation in a warm period since 1980, and 44 species even increased the number of generations after 1980. Expected ecological consequences are diverse. Since multi-voltinism has been linked to insect outbreaks they include an increase in the abundance of herbivorous pests of agriculture and forestry. However, disruption of the developmental synchrony associated with multi-voltinism and host plant phenology may also reduce fitness, potentially having unexpected consequences for species of conservation concern. The ability of species to adapt evolutionarily to a changing environment may be facilitated by increased voltinism.},

  abstract = {The majority of ectotherms grow slower but mature at a larger body size in colder environments. This phenomenon has puzzled biologists because classic theories of life-history evolution predict smaller sizes at maturity in environments that retard growth. During the last decade, intensive theoretical and empirical research has generated some plausible explanations based on nonadaptive or adaptive plasticity. Nonadaptive plasticity of body size is hypothesized to result from thermal constraints on cellular growth that cause smaller cells at higher temperatures, but the generality of this theory is poorly supported. Adaptive plasticity is hypothesized to result from greater benefits or lesser costs of delayed maturation in colder environments. These theories seem to apply well to some species but not others. Thus, no single theory has been able to explain the generality of temperature-size relationships in ectotherms. We recommend a multivariate theory that focuses on the coevolution of thermal reaction norms for growth rate and size at maturity. Such a theory should incorporate functional constraints on thermal reaction norms, as well as the natural covariation between temperature and other environmental variables.},

Life history analysis suggests that it is adaptive for adults to emerge smaller if reared in conditions that slow down juvenile growth. However, whereas smaller adults emerge if growth is limited by food availability, the reverse is usually observed if growth is limited by temperature. The resolution of this apparent paradox may be that the response of adult size to temperature is adaptive, but is constrained by a trade-off that can be understood in terms of von Bertalanffy's classic theory of growth. Alternatively, the response may be the unavoidable consequence of a fundamental relationship between cell size and temperature.},

Collections of well-studied food webs and replicate food webs from the same system that span biogeographical and ecological gradients now enable detailed, quantitative investigation of such questions and help integrate food web ecology and macroecology. Here, we integrate macroecology and food web ecology by focusing on how ecogeographical rules [the latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG), Bergmann's rule, the island rule and Rapoport's rule] are associated with the architecture of food webs. Location Global. Time period Current. Major taxa studied All taxa. Methods We discuss the implications of each ecogeographical rule for food webs, present predictions for how food web structure will vary with each rule, assess empirical support where available, and discuss how food webs may influence ecogeographical rules. Finally, we recommend systems and approaches for further advancing this research agenda. Results We derived testable predictions for some ecogeographical rules (e.g. LDG, Rapoport's rule), while for others (e.g., Bergmann's and island rules) it is less clear how we would expect food webs to change over macroecological scales. Based on the LDG, we found weak support for both positive and negative relationships between food chain length and latitude and for increased generality and linkage density at higher latitudes. Based on Rapoport's rule, we found support for the prediction that species turnover in food webs is inversely related to latitude. Main conclusions The macroecology of food webs goes beyond traditional approaches to biodiversity at macroecological scales by focusing on trophic interactions among species. The collection of food web data for different types of ecosystems across biogeographical gradients is key to advance this research agenda. Further, considering food web interactions as a selection pressure that drives or disrupts ecogeographical rules has the potential to address both mechanisms of and deviations from these macroecological relationships. For these reasons, further integration of macroecology and food webs will help ecologists better understand the assembly, maintenance and change of ecosystems across space and time.},

  abstract = {Stable isotope ratios are used to reconstruct animal diet in trophic ecology via mixing models. Several assumptions of stable isotope mixing models are critical, i.e., constant trophic discrimination factor and isotopic equilibrium between the consumer and its diet. The isotopic turnover rate ({$\lambda$} and its counterpart the half-life) affects the dynamics of isotopic incorporation for an organism and the isotopic equilibrium assumption: {$\lambda$} involves a time lag between the real assimilated diet and the diet estimated by mixing models at the individual scale. Current stable isotope mixing model studies consider neither this time lag nor even the dynamics of isotopic ratios in general. We developed a mechanistic framework using a dynamic mixing model (DMM) to assess the contribution of {$\lambda$} to the dynamics of isotopic incorporation and to estimate the bias induced by neglecting the time lag in diet reconstruction in conventional static mixing models (SMMs). The DMM includes isotope dynamics of sources (denoted {$\delta$}s), {$\lambda$} and frequency of diet-switch ({$\omega$}). The results showed a significant bias generated by the SMM compared to the DMM (up to 50\% of differences). This bias can be strongly reduced in SMMs by averaging the isotopic variations of the food sources over a time window equal to twice the isotopic half-life. However, the bias will persist ({$\sim$}15\%) for intermediate values of the {$\omega$}/{$\lambda$} ratio. The inferences generated using a case study highlighted that DMM enhanced estimates of consumer's diet, and this could avoid misinterpretation in ecosystem functioning, food-web structure analysis and underlying biological processes.},

We used a spatially explicit continuum model to quantify the effects of environmental heterogeneity, comprising abundance distribution and spatial configuration of resources, on the degree of community neutrality. We found that both components of heterogeneity affect the degree of community neutrality and that species' dispersal characteristics affect the neutrality\textendash heterogeneity relationship. Narrower resource abundance distributions decrease neutrality, while spatial configuration, which is manifested by spatial aggregation of resources, decreases neutrality at higher aggregation levels. In general, the degree of community neutrality was affected by complex interactions among spatial configuration of resources, their abundance distributions and the dispersal characteristics of species in the community. Our results highlight the important yet overlooked role of the environment in dictating the location of communities along the hypothesized niche\textendash neutrality continuum.},

Here, we argue that this novel heterogeneity will drive mobile generalist consumer species to rapidly respond through their behaviour in ways that broadly and predictably reorganize \textemdash{} or rewire \textemdash{} food webs. We use existing theory and data from diverse ecosystems to show that the rapid behavioural responses of generalists to climate change rewire food webs in two distinct and critical ways. First, mobile generalist species are redistributing into systems where they were previously absent and foraging on new prey, resulting in topological rewiring \textemdash{} a change in the patterning of food webs due to the addition or loss of connections. Second, mobile generalist species, which navigate between habitats and ecosystems to forage, will shift their relative use of differentially altered habitats and ecosystems, causing interaction strength rewiring \textemdash{} changes that reroute energy and carbon flows through existing food web connections and alter the food web's interaction strengths. We then show that many species with shared traits can exhibit unified aggregate behavioural responses to climate change, which may allow us to understand the rewiring of whole food webs. We end by arguing that generalists' responses present a powerful and underutilized approach to understanding and predicting the consequences of climate change and may serve as much-needed early warning signals for monitoring the looming impacts of global climate change on entire ecosystems.},

  abstract = {We determined the trophic basis of production and quantified the food web of caddisfly larvae from the submerged woody (snag) habitat of a Coastal Plain blackwater river (Ogeechee River). Production was dominated by three net-spinning taxa (Cheumatopsyche spp., Hydropsyche rossi, and Chimarra moselyi), comprising 97\textendash 98\% of the total among at least 14 trichopteran species. Annual production (as dry mass) was among the highest estimates reported for caddisflies, ranging from 43.5 to 63.9 g/m2 of snag surface (or from 14.2 to 25.5 g/m2 of channel bottom) in two consecutive years. Although all taxa were present throughout the year, C. moselyi had much higher production in summer, H. rossi was highest from late summer to winter, and Cheumatopsyche spp. showed no pattern. Ingestion was determined from production estimates, bioenergetic efficiencies, and quantitative gut analyses. The two macrofiltering taxa (Cheumatopsyche spp. and H. rossi) were omnivorous, with 50.6 and 64.4\% of their production, respectively, due to eating animals. Somewhat lower amounts of their production (40.7 and 23.5\%) were due to ingestion of amorphous detritus. Production of the microfiltering species Chimarra moselyi was primarily due to eating amorphous detritus (91\%). Removal of amorphous detritus from the system by the major taxa was highest in summer, and diatom removal was highest in fall, whereas animals were eaten consistently throughout the year. A quantitative food web showed that while the linkages among nine taxa were complex, the ingestion pathways were dominated by amorphous detritus (total consumption = 62.5 g{$\cdot$}m-2{$\cdot$}yr-1) and animal prey (22.3 g{$\cdot$}m-2{$\cdot$}yr-1), with {$>$}99\% of food resources being consumed by the three dominant filter-feeding taxa. A connectivity food web was misleading because it implied equivalence of all food resources and consumers when great variation in strength of linkages actually existed. These comparisons provide a strong argument for considering energy flow as a measure of linkage strength when evaluating food webs, and they cast doubt on the usefulness of oversimplified connectivity webs as a basis for food web theory.},

  abstract = {Estimation of invertebrate biomass is a critical step in addressing many ecological questions in aquatic environments. Length-dry mass regressions are the most widely used approach for estimating benthic invertebrate biomass because they are faster and more precise than other methods. A compilation and analysis of length-mass regressions using the power model, M (mass) = a L (length)\textsuperscript{b}, are presented from 30 y of data collected by the authors, primarily from the southeastern USA, along with published regressions from the rest of North America. A total of 442 new and published regressions are presented, mostly for genus or species, based on total body length or other linear measurements. The regressions include 64 families of aquatic insects and 12 families of other invertebrate groups (mostly molluscs and crustaceans). Regressions were obtained for 134 insect genera (155 species) and 153 total invertebrate genera (184 species). Regressions are provided for both body length and head width for some taxa. In some cases, regressions are provided from multiple localities for single taxa. When using body length in the equations, there were no significant differences in the mean value of the exponent b among 8 insect orders or Amphipoda. The mean value of b for insects was 2.79, ranging from only 2.69 to 2.91 among orders. The mean value of b for Decapoda (3.63), however, was significantly higher than all insects orders and amphipods. Mean values of a were not significantly different among the 8 insect orders and Amphipoda, reflecting considerable variability within orders. Reasons for potential differences in b among taxa are explained with hypothetical examples showing how b responds to changes in linear dimensions and specific gravity. When using head width as the linear dimension in the power model, the mean value of b was higher (3.11) than for body length and more variable among orders (2.8-3.3). Values of b for Ephemeroptera (3.3) were significantly higher than those for Odonata, Megaloptera, and Diptera. For those equations in which ash-free dry mass was used, \% ash varied considerably among functional feeding groups (3.3-12.4\%). Percent ash varied from 4.0\% to 8.5\% among major insect orders, but was 18.9\% for snails (without shells). Family-level regressions also are presented so that they can be used when generic equations are unavailable or when organisms are only identified to the family level. It is our intention that these regressions be used by others in estimating mass from linear dimensions, but potential errors must be recognized.},

Population density at carrying capacity plays an important role in evolutionary processes, biodiversity, and ecosystem function, yet how it varies with temperature-dependent metabolism remains unclear. Though the exponential effect of temperature on intrinsic population growth rate, r, is well known, we still lack clear evidence that population density at carrying capacity, K, declines with increasing per capita metabolic rate, as predicted by the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE). We experimentally tested whether temperature effects on photosynthesis propagate directly to population carrying capacity in a model species, the mobile phytoplankton Tetraselmis tetrahele. After maintaining populations at a fixed resource supply and fixed temperatures for 43 days, we found that carrying capacity declined with increasing temperature. This decline was predicted quantitatively when models included temperature-dependent metabolic rates and temperature-associated body-size shifts. Our results demonstrate that warming reduces carrying capacity and that temperature effects on body size and metabolic rate interact to determine how temperature affects population dynamics. These findings bolster efforts to relate metabolic temperature dependence to population and ecosystem patterns via MTE.},

  abstract = {Temperature is the most significant environmental gradient at the global scale, impacting the distributions of species and their ecological interactions. It is now established that temperature affects several biological rates and body mass, and can, in turn, alter interaction strength. Latitudinal variation in the strength of interactions has been observed for trophic and competitive interactions and many studies support that biotic interactions are more intense at low latitudes. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying the temperature dependence of trophic regulation, the effect of consumers on their preys, remain unclear. The aim of our study is to get better insights on the effects of temperature on trophic regulation. We used a consumer-resource model and considered that organisms' biological rates present a unimodal thermal response and that body mass decreases with temperature. We compared three measures of interaction strength: per capita, per population and net interaction strength. Our results demonstrate that the effect of temperature on interaction strength is contingent upon which species' biological rates are temperature dependent. When all biological rates are temperature dependent, the thermal response of interaction strength is hump-shaped following the scaling of search rate, whilst it is monotonically decreasing when only mortality rates vary with temperature. Finally, we show that temperature can indirectly impact trophic interaction strength through the temperature-size rule. A decrease in organisms' body size due to temperature induces a decrease in per capita and per population interaction strength and tend to decrease net interaction strength, depending on which trophic level follows the temperature-size rule. Our analysis gives an overview of how temperature, through various effects, may impact different measures of interaction strength.},

  abstract = {All animals on Earth compete for free energy, which is acquired, assimilated, and ultimately allocated to growth and reproduction. Competition is strongest within communities of sympatric, ecologically similar animals of roughly equal size (i.e. horizontal communities), which are often the focus of traditional community ecology. The replacement of taxonomic identities with functional traits has improved our ability to decipher the ecological dynamics that govern the assembly and functioning of animal communities. Yet, the use of low-resolution and taxonomically idiosyncratic traits in animals may have hampered progress to date. An animal's metabolic rate (MR) determines the costs of basic organismal processes and activities, thus linking major aspects of the multifaceted constructs of ecological niches (where, when, and how energy is obtained) and ecological fitness (how much energy is accumulated and passed on to future generations). We review evidence from organismal physiology to large-scale analyses across the tree of life to propose that MR gives rise to a group of meaningful functional traits \textendash{} resting metabolic rate (RMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR), and aerobic scope (AS) \textendash{} that may permit an improved quantification of the energetic basis of species coexistence and, ultimately, the assembly and functioning of animal communities. Specifically, metabolic traits integrate across a variety of typical trait proxies for energy acquisition and allocation in animals (e.g. body size, diet, mobility, life history, habitat use), to yield a smaller suite of continuous quantities that: (1) can be precisely measured for individuals in a standardized fashion; and (2) apply to all animals regardless of their body plan, habitat, or taxonomic affiliation. While integrating metabolic traits into animal community ecology is neither a panacea to disentangling the nuanced effects of biological differences on animal community structure and functioning, nor without challenges, a small number of studies across different taxa suggest that MR may serve as a useful proxy for the energetic basis of competition in animals. Thus, the application of MR traits for animal communities can lead to a more general understanding of community assembly and functioning, enhance our ability to trace eco-evolutionary dynamics from genotypes to phenotypes (and vice versa), and help predict the responses of animal communities to environmental change. While trait-based ecology has improved our knowledge of animal communities to date, a more explicit energetic lens via the integration of metabolic traits may further strengthen the existing framework.},

Still, the general distribution of consumer\textendash resource body-size ratios in real ecosystems, and whether they vary systematically among habitats or broad taxonomic groups, is poorly understood. Using a unique global database on consumer and resource body sizes, we show that the mean bodysize ratios of aquatic herbivorous and detritivorous consumers are several orders of magnitude larger than those of carnivorous predators. Carnivorous predator\textendash prey body-size ratios vary across different habitats and predator and prey types (invertebrates, ectotherm, and endotherm vertebrates). Predator\textendash prey body-size ratios are on average significantly higher (1) in freshwater habitats than in marine or terrestrial habitats, (2) for vertebrate than for invertebrate predators, and (3) for invertebrate than for ectotherm vertebrate prey. If recent studies that relate body-size ratios to interaction strengths are general, our results suggest that mean consumer\textendash resource interaction strengths may vary systematically across different habitat categories and consumer types.},

In this theme issue, we highlight a novel pathway through which warming indirectly affects ecological communities: by changing their size structure (i.e. the body-size distributions). Warming can shift these distributions towards dominance of small- over large-bodied species. The conceptual, theoretical and empirical research described in this issue, in sum, suggests that effects of temperature may be dominated by changes in size structure, with relatively weak direct effects. For example, temperature effects via size structure have implications for top-down and bottom-up control in ecosystems and may ultimately yield novel communities. Moreover, scaling up effects of temperature and body size from physiology to the levels of populations, communities and ecosystems may provide a crucially important mechanistic approach for forecasting future consequences of global warming.},

However, mangroves may also recover their ecosystem carbon stocks rapidly following restoration, potentially offsetting carbon stock losses. While studies have quantified these tradeoffs at global scales using coarse metrics, fewer studies have quantified them at national scales at higher resolution. Here, we used high-resolution data sets of LULC for mangroves in Thailand to quantify district-level gross and net changes in mangrove carbon stocks from 1960 to 2014. We found emissions based on gross gain and loss statistics (7.18 {$\pm$} 0.24 million Mg C) to be greater than those associated with emissions based on net area change statistics (1.65 {$\pm$} 0.26 million Mg C) by a factor of four. The difference in estimates arises from slower rates of carbon stock recovery following reforestation relative to carbon stock loss following LULC change. Overall, we found the greatest gains in mangrove carbon stocks to be from mangrove expansion in areas of accreting sediments, which were strongly correlated with district-level extent of undisturbed mangroves. Our results show that net loss statistics may greatly underestimate emissions associated with LULC change in mangroves. Additionally, our findings suggest that gains in mangrove carbon stocks associated with natural establishment at the periphery of standing mangroves may offset substantial carbon stock losses at national scales.},

This framework unifies ecologists' measures of species diversity, phylogenetic diversity, and distance-based functional diversity.

  abstract = {An enormous number of measures based on different criteria have been proposed to quantify evenness or unevenness among species relative abundances in an assemblage. However, a unified approach that can encompass most of the widely used indices is still lacking. Here, we first present some basic requirements for an evenness measure. We then propose that unevenness among species relative abundances in an assemblage can be measured by a normalized divergence between the vector of species relative abundances and the mean vector, where the mean vector represents the species relative abundances of a completely even assemblage. Thus, evenness among species relative abundances is measured by the corresponding normalized extent of closeness between these two vectors. We consider five divergence measures, leading to five classes of evenness indices. All our evenness measures are in terms of diversity (Hill number) of order q {$>$} 0 (here q controls the weighting of species relative abundances) and species richness (diversity of order q = 0). We propose quantifying evenness through a continuous profile that depicts evenness as a function of diversity order q {$>$} 0. The profiles can be easily and visually compared across multiple assemblages. Our evenness indices satisfy all the requirements presented in this paper and encompass many widely used evenness measures as special cases. When there are multiple assemblages, the abundance-based Jaccard- and S\o rensen-type dissimilarity measures (which are monotonic functions of beta diversity) can be expressed as weighted averages of the individual species' compositional unevenness values; here, each individual species' compositional unevenness is calculated based on that species' abundances among assemblages. The contribution of a species to each dissimilarity measure can be clearly disentangled and quantified in terms of this single species' compositional unevenness among assemblages. Thus, our framework links the concepts of evenness, diversity, beta diversity, and similarity. Moreover, the framework can be readily extended to a phylogenetic version. A real data example is used to illustrate our approach. We also discuss some criteria and other measures that were previously proposed in the literature.},

Using data from 176 benthic invertebrate assemblages distributed throughout the North Sea, we studied how a fundamental ecological function \textendash{} secondary production \textendash{} varies in relation to two components of biodiversity \textendash{} consumer species richness and evenness \textendash{} while statistically controlling the effects of abiotic and biotic covariates. Production was enhanced as richness increased or evenness decreased. The relationship with evenness was attributable to its negative covariance with the abundance of small organisms; however, the relationship with richness could not be fully explained by other drivers. Our study reaffirms experimental findings about the functional importance of biodiversity and suggests that losing or gaining consumer species will affect secondary production over a broad range of species richness (20\textendash 118 species) in natural ecosystems.},

In generalist predators in particular, individual diet specialization is likely to have important consequences for food webs. Understanding individual diet specialization empirically requires the ability to quantify individual diet preferences accurately. Here we compare the currently used frequentist maximum likelihood approach, which infers individual preferences using the observed prey proportions to Bayesian hierarchical models that instead estimate these proportions. Using simulated and empirical data, we find that the approach of using observed prey proportions consistently overestimates diet specialization relative to the Bayesian hierarchical approach when the number of prey observations per individual is low or the number of prey observations vary among individuals, two common features of empirical data. Furthermore, the Bayesian hierarchical approach permits the estimation of point estimates for both prey proportions and their variability within and among levels of organization (i.e., individuals, experimental treatments, populations), while also characterizing the uncertainty of these estimates in ways inaccessible to frequentist methods. The Bayesian hierarchical approach provides a useful framework for improving the quantification and understanding of intraspecific variation in diet specialization studies.},

By altering community composition and productivity of consumers, enrichment can indirectly cause changes in the pathways and magnitude of material flows in food webs. These changes, in turn, have major consequences for material storage and cycling in the ecosystem. Understanding mechanisms and predicting consequences of nutrient-induced changes in material flows requires a quantitative food web approach that combines information on consumer energetics and consumer\textendash resource stoichiometry. We examined effects of a whole-system experimental nutrient enrichment on the trophic basis of production and the magnitude and pathways of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) flows in a detritus-based stream food web. We compared the response of the treated stream to an adjacent reference stream throughout the study. Dietary composition and elemental flows varied considerably among invertebrate functional feeding groups. During nutrient enrichment, increased flows of leaf litter and amorphous detritus to shredders and gatherers accounted for most of the altered flows of C from basal resources to consumers. Nutrient enrichment had little effect on patterns of material flows but had large positive effects on the magnitude of C, N, and P flows to consumers (mean increase of 97\% for all elements). Nutrient-specific food webs revealed similar flows of N and P to multiple functional groups despite an order of magnitude difference among groups in consumption of C. Secondary production was more strongly related to consumption of nutrients than C, and increased material flows were positively related to the degree of consumer\textendash resource C:P and C:N imbalances. Nutrient enrichment resulted in an increased proportion of detrital C inputs consumed by primary consumers (from {$\sim$}15\% to 35\%) and a decreased proportion of invertebrate prey consumed by predators (from {$\sim$}80\% to 55\%). Our results demonstrate that nutrient enrichment of detritus-based systems may reduce stoichiometric constraints on material flows, increase the contribution of consumers to C, N, and P cycling, alter the proportion of C inputs metabolized by consumers, and potentially lead to reduced ecosystem-level storage of C.},

As a consequence, flow and temperature regimes have been altered, strongly affecting river food webs and ecosystem processes. Experimental high-flow dam releases, i.e., controlled floods, have been implemented on the Colorado River, USA, in an effort to reestablish pulsed flood events, redistribute sediments, improve conditions for native fishes, and increase understanding of how dam operations affect physical and biological processes. We quantified secondary production and organic matter flows in the food web below Glen Canyon dam for two years prior and one year after an experimental controlled flood in March 2008. Invertebrate biomass and secondary production declined significantly following the flood (total biomass, 55\% decline; total production, 56\% decline), with most of the decline driven by reductions in two nonnative invertebrate taxa, Potamopyrgus antipodarum and Gammarus lacustris. Diatoms dominated the trophic basis of invertebrate production before and after the controlled flood, and the largest organic matter flows were from diatoms to the three most productive invertebrate taxa (P. antipodarum, G. lacustris, and Tubificida). In contrast to invertebrates, production of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) increased substantially (194\%) following the flood, despite the large decline in total secondary production of the invertebrate assemblage. This counterintuitive result is reconciled by a post-flood increase in production and drift concentrations of select invertebrate prey (i.e., Chironomidae and Simuliidae) that supported a large proportion of trout production but had relatively low secondary production. In addition, interaction strengths, measured as species impact values, were strongest between rainbow trout and these two taxa before and after the flood, demonstrating that the dominant consumer\textendash resource interactions were not necessarily congruent with the dominant organic matter flows. Our study illustrates the value of detailed food web analysis for elucidating pathways by which dam management may alter production and strengths of species interactions in river food webs. We suggest that controlled floods may increase production of nonnative rainbow trout, and this information can be used to help guide future dam management decisions.},

  abstract = {Summary Environmental temperature has systematic effects on rates of species interactions, primarily through its influence on organismal physiology. We present a mechanistic model for the thermal response of consumer?resource interactions. We focus on how temperature affects species interactions via key traits ? body velocity, detection distance, search rate and handling time ? that underlie per capita consumption rate. The model is general because it applies to all foraging strategies: active-capture (both consumer and resource body velocity are important), sit-and-wait (resource velocity dominates) and grazing (consumer velocity dominates). The model predicts that temperature influences consumer?resource interactions primarily through its effects on body velocity (either of the consumer, resource or both), which determines how often consumers and resources encounter each other, and that asymmetries in the thermal responses of interacting species can introduce qualitative, not just quantitative, changes in consumer?resource dynamics. We illustrate this by showing how asymmetries in thermal responses determine equilibrium population densities in interacting consumer?resource pairs. We test for the existence of asymmetries in consumer?resource thermal responses by analysing an extensive database on thermal response curves of ecological traits for 309 species spanning 15 orders of magnitude in body size from terrestrial, marine and freshwater habitats. We find that asymmetries in consumer?resource thermal responses are likely to be a common occurrence. Overall, our study reveals the importance of asymmetric thermal responses in consumer?resource dynamics. In particular, we identify three general types of asymmetries: (i) different levels of performance of the response, (ii) different rates of response (e.g. activation energies) and (iii) different peak or optimal temperatures. Such asymmetries should occur more frequently as the climate changes and species' geographical distributions and phenologies are altered, such that previously noninteracting species come into contact. By using characteristics of trophic interactions that are often well known, such as body size, foraging strategy, thermy and environmental temperature, our framework should allow more accurate predictions about the thermal dependence of consumer?resource interactions. Ultimately, integration of our theory into models of food web and ecosystem dynamics should be useful in understanding how natural systems will respond to current and future temperature change.},

Resource supply levels clearly play a role in setting size, but in current theory, optimality functions for body size are not tied to the population dynamics that govern resource supply, minimizing our ability to understand how body size evolves in response to the ecological context. We integrated the supply-demand (SD) model of body size evolution with a model of predator\textendash prey dynamics to create a dynamic SD model that describes predator body size variation through time. We tested the model with experimental data on body size and abundance dynamics in the Didinium\textendash Paramecium predator\textendash prey system. We used a new differential equation fitting approach along with independently estimated parameters to determine whether the model could simultaneously capture both abundance and body size dynamics. The dynamics were well described by the model, supporting the notion that body size changes to match bodily demand for resources with the available supply of resources. Surprisingly, despite the 10-fold variation in Didinium body size, we found that static model parameters were sufficient to describe the data, suggesting a lack of eco-evolutionary dynamics. A pressing need in ecology is to be able to predict changes in body size under novel scenarios, especially climate warming. The dynamic SD model does this by linking body size to the ecological context in an eco-evolutionary framework. Our approach expands our ability to understand rapid linked changes in traits and abundance.},

We investigated the evolution of age at maturity through changes in the von Bertalanffy growth constant for organisms with a simple juvenile-adult life history. We used Gillespie eco-evolutionary models to uncover the role of predation in driving the evolution of the growth constant when eco-evolutionary dynamics are present. We incorporated both size-independent and size-dependent predation into our models to generate differences in selection and dynamics in the system. Our results generally support the idea that faster ontogenetic growth is beneficial when populations are growing but that predation tends to have little effect on age at maturity unless there are trade-offs with other life history traits. In particular, if faster ontogenetic growth comes at the cost of fecundity, our results suggest that predation selects for intermediate levels of growth and fecundity. Eco-evolutionary dynamics influenced the nature of selection only when growth was linked to fecundity. We also found that predators that increasingly consume larger prey tend to have higher population sizes due to the greater energy intake from larger prey, but the growth rate-fecundity trade-off reversed this pattern. Overall, our results suggest an important role for interactions between size-dependent foraging and life-history trade-offs in generating varying selection on age at maturity through underlying growth traits.},

  abstract = {1. It is becoming increasingly clear that fresh waters play a major role in the global C cycle. Stream ecosystem respiration (ER) and gross primary productivity (GPP) exert a significant control on organic carbon fluxes in fluvial networks. However, little is known about how climate change will influence these fluxes. 2. Here, we used a `natural experiment' to demonstrate the role of temperature and nutrient cycling in whole-system metabolism (ER, GPP and net ecosystem production \textendash{} NEP), in naturally heated geothermal (5\textendash 25 \textdegree C) Icelandic streams. 3. We calculated ER and GPP with a new, more accurate method, which enabled us to take into account the additional uncertainties owing to stream spatial heterogeneity in oxygen concentrations within a reach. ER ranged 1\textendash 25 g C m-2 day-1 and GPP 1\textendash 10 g C m-2 day-1. The median uncertainties (based on 1 SD) in ER and GPP were 50\% and 20\%, respectively. 4. Despite extremely low water nutrient concentrations, high metabolic rates in the warm streams were supported by fast cycling rates of nutrients, as revealed from inorganic nutrient (N, P) addition experiments. 5. ER exceeded GPP in all streams (with average GPP/ER = 0.6) and was more strongly related to temperature than GPP, resulting in elevated negative NEP with warming. We show that, as a first approximation based on summer investigations, global stream carbon emission to the atmosphere would nearly double from 0.12 Pg C year-1 at 13 \textdegree C to 0.21 (0.15\textendash 0.33) Pg C year-1 with a 5 \textdegree C warming. 6. Compared to previous studies from natural systems (including terrestrial ecosystems), the temperature dependence of stream metabolism was not confounded by latitude or altitude, seasonality, light and nutrient availability, water chemistry, space availability (water transient storage), and water availability. 7. Consequently, stream nutrient processing is likely to increase with warming, protecting downstream ecosystems (rivers, estuaries, coastal marine systems) during the summer low flows from nutrient enrichment, but at the cost of increased CO2 flux back to the atmosphere.},

We derive a predictive model for body size responses to temperature and oxygen (O               2               ) changes based on thermal and geometric constraints on organismal O               2               supply and demand across the size spectrum. The model reproduces three key aspects of the observed patterns of intergenerational size reductions measured in laboratory warming experiments of diverse aquatic ectotherms (i.e., the ``temperature-size rule'' [TSR]). First, the interspecific mean and variability of the TSR is predicted from species' temperature sensitivities of hypoxia tolerance, whose nonlinearity with temperature also explains the second TSR pattern\textemdash its amplification as temperatures rise. Third, as body size increases across the tree of life, the impact of growth on O               2               demand declines while its benefit to O               2               supply rises, decreasing the size dependence of hypoxia tolerance and requiring larger animals to contract by a larger fraction to compensate for a thermally driven rise in metabolism. Together our results support O               2               limitation as the mechanism underlying the TSR, and they provide a physiological basis for projecting ectotherm body size responses to climate change from microbes to macrofauna. For small species unable to rapidly migrate or evolve greater hypoxia tolerance, ocean warming and O               2               loss in this century are projected to induce {$>$}20\% reductions in body mass.

Although the hollow curve may be a statistical artefact, ecological processes may induce subtle deviations between empirical species abundance distributions and their statistically most probable forms. These deviations may reflect biological processes operating on top of mathematical constraints and provide new avenues for advancing ecological theory.

To explore microbial responses to global warming, we incubated eight alpine soils between 4 and 35~\textdegree C and linked the temperature dependency of bacterial growth with alterations in community structures and the identification of temperature sensitive taxa. The temperature optimum for bacterial growth was between 27 and 30~\textdegree C and was higher in soils from warmer environments. This temperature framing the upper limit of naturally occurring temperatures was a tipping point above which the temperature range for growth shifted towards higher temperatures together with pronounced changes in community structures and diversity based on both 16S rRNA gene and transcript sequencing. For instance, at the highest temperature, we observed a strong increase in OTUs affiliated with Burkholderia-Paraburkholderia, Phenylobacterium, Pseudolabrys, Edaphobacter and Sphingomonas. Dominance at high temperature was explained by a priori adaptation to high temperature, high growth potential as well as stress resistance. At the highest temperature, we moreover observed an overall increase in copiotrophic properties in the community along with high growth rates. Further, temperature effects on community structures depended on the long-term climatic legacy of the soils. These findings contribute to extrapolating from single to multiple sites across a large range of conditions.},

It is an emergent, unitless property that is difficult to measure, and responds dynamically to environmental and ecosystem changes. Because the consequences of changes in transfer efficiency compound through ecosystems, slight variations can have large effects on food availability for top predators. Here, we review the processes controlling transfer efficiency, approaches to estimate it, and known variations across ocean biomes. Both process-level analysis and observed macroscale variations suggest that ecosystem-scale transfer efficiency is highly variable, impacted by fishing, and will decline with climate change. It is important that we more fully resolve the processes controlling transfer efficiency in models to effectively anticipate changes in marine ecosystems and fisheries resources.},

  abstract = {1. The chief objectives were to determine the daily optimum energy intake (COPT cal day-1) for growth and the gross efficiency (KG\%) for converting energy intake into growth for brown trout, Salmo trutta. Energy budgets for individual fish were obtained from experiments with 292 trout (initial live weight 1\textendash 318 g) bred from wild parents, and kept at five constant temperatures (5, 10, 13, 15, 18 \textdegree C) and 100\% oxygen saturation. Most trout (252) were fed over a period of 42 days on a fixed ration of shrimps, Gammarus pulex, the ration levels varying between zero and maximum, but 40 of the larger trout were fed to satiation on freshly-killed sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus). 2. Energetics models developed in earlier studies on the same data were summarized briefly and were used to predict the relationship between the change in the total energy content of a trout (CG cal day-1) and its energy intake (CIN cal day-1), and hence to estimate COPT. The models were also used to predict the relationship between KG and CIN. In both comparisons, there was good agreement between observed values from the experiments and expected mean values predicted from the models. For trout feeding on invertebrates, COPT lay closer to the maximum, rather than the maintenance, energy intake. When the diet changed from invertebrates to fish, there was a marked increase in CIN, CG and KG. 3. For trout feeding on invertebrates, KG exceeded 30\% within 7\textendash 11 \textdegree C, with a maximum KG of 31.8\% at 8.9 \textdegree C. For piscivorous trout, KG exceeded 30\% within 4\textendash 16 \textdegree C and 40\% within 6.5\textendash 12 \textdegree C, with a maximum KG of 41.8\% at 9.3 \textdegree C. These differences were discussed in relation to the results of previous workers, and the models used in the present study provided a method of exploring the limitations of the `K-line' hypothesis for the relationship between KG and CIN.},

Because metabolism is a fundamental process underlying many individual- and population-level variables, it provides a mechanism for linking individual characteristics with large-scale processes. Here we use metabolism and ecosystem thermodynamics to scale from physiology to individual biomass production and population-level energy use. Temperature-corrected rates of individual-level biomass production show the same body-size dependence across a wide range of aerobic eukaryotes, from unicellular organisms to mammals and vascular plants. Population-level energy use for both mammals and plants are strongly influenced by both metabolism and thermodynamic constraints on energy exchange between trophic levels. Our results show that because metabolism is a fundamental trait of organisms, it not only provides a link between individual- and ecosystem-level processes, but can also highlight other important factors constraining ecological structure and dynamics.},

It is often assumed that the thermal responses of physiological rates are coupled to metabolic rate and thus have the same temperature dependence. However, the existence of the temperature-size rule suggests that intraspecific growth and development are decoupled. Decoupling of these rates would have important consequences for individual species and ecosystems, yet this has not been tested systematically across a range of species. We conducted an analysis on growth and development rate data compiled from the literature for a well-studied group, marine pelagic copepods, and use an information-theoretic approach to test which equations best describe these rates. Growth and development rates were best characterized by models with significantly different parameters: development has stronger temperature dependence than does growth across all life stages. As such, it is incorrect to assume that these rates have the same temperature dependence. We used the best-fit models for these rates to predict changes in organism mass in response to temperature. These predictions follow a concave relationship, which complicates attempts to model the impacts of increasing global temperatures on species body size.},

However, very few studies simultaneously use experimental approaches to characterize the ecological niches of species and directly assess the importance of these structuring processes. In this study, we developed an experimental approach for quantifying the use of four types of food resources and three habitat templets in temperate forest ant assemblages. We then used null models to assess whether niches overlapped more or less than expected by chance. Finally, we integrated comparative phylogenetic methods with experimental data on niche use to assess the degree of phylogenetic signal in several key components of the niche. We found that niche filtering, rather than partitioning, was the predominant structuring force. Niche filtering resulted from conservatism in habitat niches in evolutionary time and limitations in the availability of food resources in ecological time. Our study thus supports the idea that similarities in niches among species, rather than the differences, drive the assembly of ant communities.},

Summer temperature (August\textendash September) ranged between 6 and 23 \textdegree C. 2. Macroinvertebrate evenness and species overlap decreased significantly with temperature whereas taxon richness showed no response. In total, 35 macroinvertebrate species were found with Chironomidae the dominant taxonomic group. Macroinvertebrate density increased significantly with temperature. Dominant species in the warm streams were Lymnaea peregra and Simulium vittatum. Algal biomass, macrophyte cover and richness were unrelated to temperature. Densities of trout (Salmo trutta), the only fish species present, reflected habitat conditions and to a lesser degree temperature. 3. Density of filter-feeders increased significantly with temperature whereas scraper density, the other dominant functional feeding group, was unrelated to temperature. Stable isotope analysis revealed a positive relationship between {$\delta$}15N and temperature across several trophic levels. No pattern was found with regard to {$\delta$}13C and temperature. 4. Leaf litter decomposition in both fine and coarse mesh leaf bags were significantly correlated to temperature. In coarse mesh leaf packs breakdown rates were almost doubled compared with fine mesh, ranging between 0.5 and 1.3 g DW 28 days-1. Nutrient diffusion substrates showed that the streams were primarily nitrogen limited across the temperature gradient while a significant additional effect of phosphorous was found with increasing temperature. 5. Structural and functional attributes gave complementary information which all indicated a change with temperature similar to what is found in moderately polluted streams. Our results therefore suggest that lotic ecosystems could be degraded by global warming.},

In large mammals body size at first increases with latitude, but then reverses between 53 and 65\textdegree{} N, so that small body sizes occur at the lowest and highest latitudes. This is predicted by the hypothesis that body size follows the duration of the annual productivity pulse, so that body size is a function of availability of nutrients and energy during periods of growth. Correlations between body size and temperature are shown to be spurious. If reduction in relative surface area is indeed an adaptation to conserve heat, then mammals should increase in size from south to north at rates two orders of magnitude greater than they do.

We show that cell shape, but not size, changes with resource levels and type, and is linked to carrying capacity, thus affecting population dynamics. Also, these changes lead to differential susceptibility to predation, with direct consequences for predator-prey dynamics.

We show that larger phenotypic variation increases connectivity among predators and their prey as well as total food intake rate. For predators able to eat only a few species (i.e., specialists), low phenotypic variation maximizes intake rates, while the opposite is true for consumers with broader diets (i.e., generalists). We also show that variation sets predator trophic level by determining interaction strengths with prey at different trophic levels. Merging these results, we make two general predictions about the structure of food webs: (i) trophic level should increase with predator connectivity, and (ii) interaction strengths should decrease with prey trophic level. We confirm these predictions empirically using a global dataset of well-resolved food webs. Our results provide understanding of the processes structuring food webs that include functional traits and their naturally occurring variation.},

Using the best resolved available food webs to date, I address whether latitude, temperature, or both, explain the number of species and feeding interactions, the proportion of basal and top species, as well as the degree of omnivory, connectance and the number of trophic levels across food webs. I found that temperature is a more parsimonious predictor of food web structure than latitude. Temperature directly reduces the number of species, the proportion of basal species and the number of interactions while it indirectly increases omnivory levels, connectance and trophic level through its direct~effects on the fraction and number of basal species. While direct impacts of temperature are routinely taken into account to predict how ecosystems may respond to global climate change, indirect effects have been largely overlooked. These results thus suggest that food webs may be affected by a combination of biotic and abiotic conditions, both directly and indirectly, in a changing world.},

Because many ecological rates are constrained by temperature, new approaches are required to understand how simultaneous changes in multiple rates alter the relative performance of species and their trophic interactions. We develop an energetic approach to identify the relationship between biomass fluxes and standing biomass across trophic levels. Our approach links ecological rates and trophic dynamics to measure temperature-dependent changes to the strength of trophic interactions and determine how these changes alter food web stability. It accomplishes this by using biomass as a common energetic currency and isolating three temperature-dependent processes that are common to all consumer\textendash resource interactions: biomass accumulation of the resource, resource consumption and consumer mortality. Using this framework, we clarify when and how temperature alters consumer to resource biomass ratios, equilibrium resilience, consumer variability, extinction risk and transient vs. equilibrium dynamics. Finally, we characterise key asymmetries in species responses to temperature that produce these distinct dynamic behaviours and identify when they are likely to emerge.

More recently, some authors have argued that evidence exists for generally positive selection on individual body size in contemporary populations, providing a microevolutionary mechanism for Cope's rule. If larger body size confers individual fitness advantages as the selection estimates suggest, thereby explaining Cope's rule, then body size should increase over microevolutionary time scales. We test this corollary by assembling a large database of studies reporting changes in phenotypic body size through time in contemporary populations, as well as studies reporting average breeding values for body size through time. Trends in body size were quite variable with an absence of any general trend, and many populations trended toward smaller body sizes. Although selection estimates can be interpreted to support Cope's rule, our results suggest that actual rates of phenotypic change for body size cannot. We discuss potential reasons for this discrepancy and its implications for the understanding of Cope's rule.},

From this model, we predict and test whether the relative importance of niche vs. neutral processes in controlling community dynamics will vary depending on community species richness, niche overlap and dispersal capabilities of species (both local and long distance). Results demonstrate that niche and neutrality form ends of a continuum from competitive to stochastic exclusion. In the absence of immigration, competitive exclusion tends to create a regular spacing of niches. However, immigration prevents the establishment of a limiting similarity. The equilibrium community consists of a set of complementary and redundant species, with their abundance determined, respectively, by the distribution of environmental conditions and the amount of immigration.},

Human-caused reddening of noise \textemdash{} increasing the autocorrelation of noise \textemdash{} may make sudden population disappearances more likely because red noise can enlarge the period and magnitude of perturbations, potentially overwhelming species' natural compensatory responses and pushing species' population dynamics away from equilibria into transient dynamics and close to extinction. Furthermore, species' natural compensatory responses are related to life history along the slow-fast continuum. This interaction of slow-fast life history plus red noise may be a potent factor producing sudden population disappearances. Using a simple mathematical technique with the classic Rozenzweig-MacArthur consumer resource model, we created an experiment varying the consumer's maximum population growth rate, effectively varying the consumer's life history along the slow-fast continuum. Initial slowing of the consumer's growth rate increased the stability of the consumer-resource model with added stochasticity. Slowing the consumer's growth rate further and reddening the noise decreased the stability with population disappearances occurring frequently. Taken together, we have shown that slow life histories can both stabilize or destabilize interactions depending on the relative speeds within the interaction. Disconcertingly with a reddening world, larger and slower organisms may be especially prone to experiencing transient-driven sudden population disappearances.},

The entropy maximization (EM) formalism looks particularly attractive, as it provides a simple algorithm to infer detailed system variables from a limited number of constraints. However, we point out that a blind application of this formalism can easily lead to wrong conclusions. To illustrate this, we reanalyze an ecological data set that has been used to claim the good performance of EM in predicting species abundances from trait measurements. We show that these results are entirely due to the restrictive constraints, and do not provide any support for the applicability of EM in ecology. By comparing with a simple example from physics, we indicate which characteristic mechanism of EM, and of statistical mechanics in general, is missing for the ecological example. This analysis introduces a series of methods to evaluate future attempts to apply EM in ecology.},

Neutral theory attributes a central role to migration processes and demographic stochasticity. One possibility to bridge these two theories is to combine them in a common mathematical framework. Here we propose a mathematical model that integrates the two perspectives. From a niche-based perspective, our model can be interpreted as a Lotka\textendash Volterra model with symmetric interactions in which we introduce immigration and demographic stochasticity. From a neutral perspective, it can be interpreted as Hubbell's local community model in which we introduce a difference between intra- and interspecific interactions. We investigate the stationary species abundance distribution and other community properties as functions of the interaction coefficient, the immigration rate and the strength of demographic stochasticity.},

Mean individual body size should therefore decline, which also implies a loss of biomass at higher trophic levels. If resources are plentiful and easily assimilated, however, the required to persist in warmer environments may be attained, leading to faster growth rates and an overall increase in the biomass of apex predators. Here, we investigated the response of different trophic groups to increasing temperature in a system of geothermal streams in Iceland, exposed to a temperature gradient of 5\textendash 21\textdegree C. These streams provide an ideal natural experiment for isolating the effects of warming in multispecies systems, as they have broadly similar geographical and physicochemical features. The macrophyte cover increased significantly with increasing stream temperature, suggesting a greater resource pool for macroinvertebrates (either through direct grazing or feeding on epiphytes). This was reflected by a greater number of generations in 1 year among macroinvertebrates: species in the coldest streams were either uni- or bivoltine, while those in the warmer streams were mostly bivoltine or multivoltine. Differences in phenology were also seen among streams, with emergence of adults limited mostly to the summer months in the colder streams, but occurring year-round in the warmer streams. Macroinvertebrates also grew faster with increasing temperature, contributing to greater population biomass and secondary production in the warmer streams. This increase in prey availability likely produced more favourable conditions for top predators in the warmer streams, leading to an increasing biomass of brown trout with increasing temperature. These findings suggest that warming does not necessarily favour the small in aquatic ecosystems, with high-resource availability, faster reproductive and growth rates and greater production all contributing to meet the high-metabolic demands of apex predators in warmer environments.},

It accurately captures the relationship among these state variables in 42 data sets, including vegetation and arthropod communities, that span a wide variety of spatial scales and habitats.

Whereas the effects of species loss on ecosystem processes have received broad attention, the consequences of altered species dominance for emergent properties of communities and ecosystems are poorly investigated. Here we propose a framework guiding our understanding of how dominance affects species interactions within communities, processes within ecosystems, and dynamics on regional scales. Dominance (or the complementary term, evenness) reflects the distribution of traits in a community, which in turn affects the strength and sign of both intraspecifc and interspecific interactions. Consequently, dominance also mediates the effect of such interactions on species coexistence. We review the evidence for the fact that dominance directly affects ecosystem functions such as process rates via species identity (the dominant trait) and evenness (the frequency distribution of traits), and indirectly alters the relationship between process rates and species richness. Dominance also influences the temporal and spatial variability of aggregate community properties and compositional stability (invasibility). Finally, we propose that dominance affects regional species coexistence by altering metacommunity dynamics. Local dominance leads to high beta diversity, and rare species can persist because of source\textendash sink dynamics, but anthropogenically induced environmental changes result in regional dominance and low beta diversity, reducing regional coexistence. Given the rapid anthropogenic alterations of dominance in many ecosystems and the strong implications of these changes, dominance should be considered explicitly in the analysis of consequences of altered biodiversity.},

Predicting how river ecosystems respond to warming has been hindered by a dearth of information about how otherwise well-studied physiological responses to temperature scale from organismal to ecosystem levels. We conducted an ecosystem-level temperature manipulation to quantify how coupling of stream ecosystem metabolism and nutrient uptake responded to a realistic warming scenario. A \textasciitilde 3.3\textdegree C increase in mean water temperature altered coupling of C, N, and P fluxes in ways inconsistent with single-species laboratory experiments. Net primary production tripled during the year of experimental warming, while whole-stream N and P uptake rates did not change, resulting in 289\% and 281\% increases in autotrophic dissolved inorganic N and P use efficiency (UE), respectively. Increased ecosystem production was a product of unexpectedly large increases in mass-specific net primary production and autotroph biomass, supported by (i) combined increases in resource availability (via N mineralization and N2 fixation) and (ii) elevated resource use efficiency, the latter associated with changes in community structure. These large changes in C and nutrient cycling could not have been predicted from the physiological effects of temperature alone. Our experiment provides clear ecosystem-level evidence that warming can shift the balance between C and nutrient cycling in rivers, demonstrating that warming will alter the important role of in-stream processes in C, N, and P transformations. Moreover, our results reveal a key role for nutrient supply and use efficiency in mediating responses of primary producers to climate warming.},

  abstract = {Light and temperature are key drivers of ecosystem productivity, but synchrony of their annual cycles typically obscures their relative influence. The coupling of annual light\textendash temperature regimes also drives complementary seasonal cycles of energy supply (primary production) and demand (metabolism), perhaps promoting temporal stability in carbon (C) storage and food web production that may be difficult to discern in most ecosystems. Spring-fed streams in the Arctic are subject to extreme annual fluctuations in light availability but have relatively stable water temperatures, which allows assessment of the independent effects of light and temperature. We used the unusual annual light and temperature regimes of Ivishak Spring, Alaska, USA (latitude 69\textdegree{} N, annual water temperature range 4\textendash 7\textdegree C) to test predictions about the effect of light availability on consumer productivity with minimally confounding effects of temperature. We predicted that (1) annual patterns of secondary production would follow patterns of primary production, rather than temperature, due to organic C limitation during winter darkness when photosynthesis is effectively halted, (2) C limitation would propagate from primary producers upward through several trophic levels, (3) the lack of temperature dependence during winter darkness would be expressed as anomalous Arrhenius plots of growth rates indicating decoupled production-temperature relationships, and (4) consumer diets would reflect C limitation during winter. As predicted, we found (1) lowest production by macroinvertebrates and Salvelinus malma (Dolly Varden char) at the lowest light levels rather than the lowest temperatures, (2) apparent winter C limitation propagated upward through three trophic levels, (3) anomalous Arrhenius plots indicating lack of temperature dependence of consumer growth rates during winter, and (4) lowest consumption of diatoms (by macroinvertebrates) and invertebrate prey (by S. malma) during winter. Together, these results indicate that light drives annual patterns of animal production in Ivishak Spring, with stable annual temperatures likely exacerbating C limitation of ectotherm metabolism during winter. The timing and severity of winter C limitation in this unusual Arctic-spring food web highlight a fundamental role for light\textendash temperature synchrony in matching energy supply with demand in most other ecosystem types, thereby conferring a measure of stability in the metabolism of their food webs over annual time scales.},

  abstract = {Diet composition is among the most important yet least understood dimensions of animal ecology. Inspired by the study of species abundance distributions (SADs), we tested for generalities in the structure of vertebrate diets by characterising them as dietary abundance distributions (DADs). We compiled data on 1167 population-level diets, representing {$>$}500 species from six vertebrate classes, spanning all continents and oceans. DADs near-universally (92.5\%) followed a hollow-curve shape, with scant support for other plausible rank-abundance-distribution shapes. This strong generality is inherently related to, yet incompletely explained by, the SADs of available food taxa. By quantifying dietary generalisation as the half-saturation point of the cumulative distribution of dietary abundance (sp50, minimum number of foods required to account for 50\% of diet), we found that vertebrate populations are surprisingly specialised: in most populations, fewer than three foods accounted for at least half the diet. Variation in sp50 was strongly associated with consumer type, with carnivores being more specialised than herbivores or omnivores. Other methodological (sampling method and effort, taxonomic resolution), biological (body mass, frugivory) and biogeographic (latitude) factors influenced sp50 to varying degrees. Future challenges include identifying the mechanisms underpinning the hollow-curve DAD, its generality beyond vertebrates, and the biological determinants of dietary generalisation.},

  abstract = {There is a high degree of concordance among the patterns of geographic size variation in birds in the eastern and central United States. This is demonstrated for 12 species by assuming that wing length measurements are an indicator of body size on the intraspecific level, and by arranging the data in the form of a grid of means of wing lengths for sample areas. Maps giving isophenetic lines for wing length indicate gradually increasing size clines northward and westward from Florida in the Hairy Woodpecker (Dendrocopos villosus), Dowy Woodpecker (Dendrocopos pubescens), Blue Jay (Cyanocitta cristata), Carolina Chickadee (Parus carolinensis), White\textemdash breasted Nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis), and Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella Magna). In each case there is a trend for larger (or longer\textemdash winged) birds to extend southward in the Appalachian Mountains and for smaller (or shorter\textemdash winged) birds to extend northward in the Mississippi River valley. Maps made by a computer and automatic plotter using contour intervals of 0.5 mm of mean wing length for the Downy Woodpecker, for male White\textemdash breasted Nuthatches, and for female Blue Jays show that, in addition to the patter just mentioned, relatively longer\textemdash winged birds extend southward in the interior highlands of Arkansas, and relatively shorter\textemdash winged birds extend northward up other river valleys. These subtle relationships between intraspecific size variation and topographic features suggest that the link between the two phenomena may be precise adaptations to even minor climatic gradients. The relationship between these findings and the subspecies concept is discussed. Correlation coefficients for the patter of variation in the Downy Woodpecker with seasonal and annual wet\textemdash bulb temperature, vapor pressure, and absolute humidity were all either equal to or higher than correlations with dry\textemdash bulb temperature. Since these variables reflect the combined effects of temperature and humidity, the obvious indication is that size variation is more closely related to this combination than to temperature alone. Additional correlations using the mean wing length data for seven other species confirmed that wet\textemdash bulb temperature patterms are more closely related to bird size than either dry\textemdash bulb temperature patters or latitude. These relationship can be expressed numerically as regressions of mean wing length on either annual wet\textemdash bulb temperature or mean annual total heat per pound of air. Since increased evaporation at high altitudes and in arid areas accentuates the depression of a wet\textemdash bulb thermometer, my hypothesis may partially account for several cases of size variation in birds cited by others as disturbing exceptions to Bergmann's ecogeographic rule. Sections of a translation of Bergmann's paper published in 1847 are given. The biological mechanisms by which these relationships are maintainted are unknown, and the wide range of tolerance by birds to diurnal and seasonal temperature variations tends to mask them. If the well\textemdash established inverse relationship between weight and metabolic rate per gram of homeotherms is operative on the intraspecific level, the relationships can be discussed in terms of avenues of heat loss and of energy budget equations.},

  abstract = {Understanding the connections between biological communities and elemental cycles is increasingly important given that alterations to both are occurring on a global scale. Biological control of elemental cycles is tied to patterns of biomass and the elemental stoichiometry of organisms and organic matter (OM) pools that comprise ecosystems. The structure and size of these ecosystem components are, in turn, shaped by key environmental factors that influence species composition, functional traits, and OM and element storage. In stream and river ecosystems, temperature and flow regime have a strong influence on ecosystem structure and function, yet little is known about their relative importance in driving patterns of ecosystem OM and stoichiometry. We quantified ecosystem OM pools and elemental stoichiometry in 11 Icelandic streams across a wide gradient of temperature (\textasciitilde\,5 to 25~\textdegree C) and flow. Across these environmental gradients, we observed two orders of magnitude variation in ecosystem OM mass, as well as relatively large variation in certain ecosystem stoichiometries (that is, C:N, C:P). We found that flow regime was more important than temperature in driving variation in OM pools and stoichiometry because of large shifts in community structure, that is, from dominance by large-bodied macrophyte and bryophyte communities to epilithic and detrital OM pools. Although temperature is known to influence mass-specific rates of metabolic and chemical processes, our study suggests that the flow disturbance regime may be the dominant control on patterns of OM storage and may thus control ecosystem fluxes by constraining ecosystem OM pool mass, organism size structure, and stoichiometric traits.},

  abstract = {Basically all organisms can be classified as determinate growers if their growth stops or almost stops at maturation, or indeterminate growers if growth is still intense after maturation. Adult size for determinate growers is relatively well defined, whereas in indeterminate growers usually two measures are used: size at maturation and asymptotic size. The latter term is in fact not a direct measure but a parameter of a specific growth equation, most often Bertalanffy's growth curve. At a given food level, the growth rate in determinate growers depends under given food level on physiological constraints as well as on investments in repair and other mechanisms that improve future survival. The growth rate in indeterminate growers consists of two phases: juvenile and adult. The mechanisms determining the juvenile growth rate are similar to those in determinate growers, whereas allocation to reproduction (dependent on external mortality rate) seems to be the main factor limiting adult growth. Optimal resource allocation models can explain the temperature-size rule (stating that usually ectotherms grow slower in cold but attain larger size) if the exponents of functions describing the size-dependence of the resource acquisition and metabolic rates change with temperature or mortality increases with temperature. Emerging data support both assumptions. The results obtained with the aid of optimization models represent just a rule and not a law: it is possible to find the ranges of production parameters and mortality rates for which the temperature-size rule does not hold.},

The continuum concept uses niche separation, an attribute of the community, to test the hypothesis that communities are bounded by pure niche or pure neutral conditions. It does not accommodate interactions via feedback between processes and the environment. By contrast, we introduce the Community Assembly Phase Space (CAPS), a multi-dimensional space that uses community processes (such as dispersal and niche selection) to define the limiting neutral and niche conditions and to test the continuum hypothesis. We compare the outputs of modelled communities in a heterogeneous landscape, assembled by pure neutral, pure niche and composite processes. Differences in patterns under different combinations of processes in CAPS reveal hidden complexity in neutral\textendash niche community dynamics. The neutral\textendash niche continuum only holds for strong dispersal limitation and niche separation. For weaker dispersal limitation and niche separation, neutral and niche processes amplify each other via feedback with the environment. This generates patterns that lie well beyond those predicted by a continuum. Inferences drawn from patterns about community assembly processes can therefore be misguided when based on the continuum perspective. CAPS also demonstrates the complementary information value of different patterns for inferring community processes and captures the complexity of community assembly. It provides a general tool for studying the processes structuring communities and can be applied to address a range of questions in community and metacommunity ecology.},

Food-dependent growth and within-species size variation depend on temperature and affect community dynamics through feedbacks between individual performance and population size structure. Still, we know little about how warming affects these feedbacks. Using a dynamic stage-structured biomass model with food-, size- and temperature-dependent life history processes, we analyse how temperature affects coexistence, stability and size structure in a tri-trophic food chain, and find that warming effects on community stability depend on ecological interactions. Predator biomass densities generally decline with warming \textendash{} gradually or through collapses \textendash{} depending on which consumer life stage predators feed on. Collapses occur when warming induces alternative stable states via Allee effects. This suggests that predator persistence in warmer climates may be lower than previously acknowledged and that effects of warming on food web stability largely depend on species interactions.},

As a result, food web theory has experienced a proliferation of research seeking to address these critical areas. Arguing that the various recent and classical food web theories can be looked at collectively and in a highly consistent and testable way, this book synthesizes and reconciles modern and classical perspectives into a general unified theory. The book brings together outcomes from population-, community-, and ecosystem-level approaches under the common currency of energy or material fluxes. It shows that these approaches\textemdash often studied in isolation\textemdash all have the same general implications in terms of stability of the population dynamics. Specifically, increased fluxes of energy or material tend to destabilize populations, communities, and whole ecosystems. With this understanding, stabilizing structures at different levels of the ecological hierarchy can be identified and any population-, community-, or ecosystem-level structures that mute energy or material flow also stabilize systems dynamics. The book uses this powerful general framework to discuss the effects of human impact on ecological stability and sustainability, and it demonstrates that there is clear empirical evidence that the structures supporting ecological systems have been dangerously eroded. Uniting the latest research on food webs with classical theories, this book will be a standard source in the understanding of natural food web functions.},

Numerous exceptions have, however, been noted including complete pyramidal inversions. Elevated levels of biomass top-heaviness (i.e. high consumer/resource biomass ratios) have been reported from Arctic tundra communities to Brazilian phytotelmata, and in species assemblages as diverse as those dominated by sharks and ants. We highlight two major pathways for creating top-heaviness, via: (1) endogenous channels that enhance energy transfer across trophic boundaries within a community and (2) exogenous pathways that transfer energy into communities from across spatial and temporal boundaries. Consumer\textendash resource models and allometric trophic network models combined with niche models reveal the nature of core mechanisms for promoting top-heaviness. Outputs from these models suggest that top-heavy communities can be stable, but they also reveal sources of instability. Humans are both increasing and decreasing top-heaviness in nature with ecological consequences. Current and future research on the drivers of top-heaviness can help elucidate fundamental mechanisms that shape the architecture of ecological communities and govern energy flux within and between communities. Questions emerging from the study of top-heaviness also usefully draw attention to the incompleteness and inconsistency by which ecologists often establish definitional boundaries for communities.},

Ingestion rates were measured using food sources (diatoms, finely ground watercress, bacteria, and blue-green algae) labelled with /sup 51/Cr and /sup 14/C. Theoretical ingestion rates were calculated from analyses of gut weights and digestion times. Assimilation efficiencies (AE) were determined using the /sup 14/C and dual-label (/sup 51/Cr, /sup 14/C) methods and the ash-ratio technique. The dual-label method provided reliable results when leaching of isotopes from food and feces were not significant. Provided the /sup 51/Cr activity density of food is sufficient, the time required for digestion can also be more accurately determined with /sup 51/Cr than with /sup 14/C. The ash-ratio method provided a wide range of AE values and is not as reliable as the dual-label method because mineral assimilationis unpredictable. Assimilation rates were derived for these animals using the ingestion rate and AE, by several methods employing /sup 14/C uptake curves, and by differences in /sup 51/Cr- and /sup 14/C-derived accumulation values. Methods used to measure other energy budget components are also given. A system was developed for combusting biological samples containing /sup 14/C and determining cpm /sup 14/C and total carbon from a single sample. This method employs Van Slyke wet oxidation, forced circulation and scrubbing of the gases of combustion, and collection of CO/sub 2/ in ethanolamine. Radioactivity in this system was determined by scintillation counting and total carbon by a gravimetric precipitation method. (auth)},

  abstract = {Ecologists often believe the discovery of mechanism to be the central goal of scientific research. While many macroecologists have inherited this view, to date they have been much more efficient at producing patterns than identifying their underlying processes. We discuss several possible attitudes for macroecologists to adopt in this context while also arguing that in fact macroecology already has many mechanisms that are ignored. We briefly describe six of these: central limit theorem, fractals, random sampling and placement, neutral theory (and descendents), concordance of forces, and maximum entropy. We explore why these mechanisms are overlooked and discuss whether they should be. We conclude that macroecology needs to take a more pragmatic, less ideological approach to mechanism. We apply this viewpoint to the recent controversy over maximum entropy and suggest that maximum entropy needs to be viewed more pragmatically and less ideologically.},

Here, we argue that winter periods of reduced temperature and light (and potentially oxygen and resources) could play an underappreciated role in mediating the coexistence of species. This may be especially true for temperate and subarctic lakes, where seasonal changes in the thermal environment might fundamentally structure species interactions. With climate change already shortening ice-covered periods on temperate and polar lakes, consideration of how winter conditions shape biotic interactions is urgently needed. Using freshwater fishes in northern temperate lakes as a case study, we demonstrate how physiological trait differences (e.g., thermal preference, light sensitivity) drive differential responses to winter among competing species. Specifically, some species have higher a capacity for winter activity than others. Existing and new theory is presented to argue that such differential responses to winter can promote species coexistence. Importantly, if winter is a driver of niche differences that weaken competition among species, then shrinking winter periods could threaten coexistence by tipping the scales in favor of certain sets of species over others.},

We compiled data on geographic variation in lifespan in ectotherms from around the globe to determine how much of this intraspecific variation in lifespan may be explained by temperature using the simple predictions of the metabolic theory of ecology. We found that the metabolic theory accurately predicts how lifespan varies with temperature within species in a wide range of ectotherms in both controlled laboratory experiments and free-living populations. After removing the effect of temperature, only a small fraction of species showed significant trends with latitude. There was, however, considerable residual intraspecific variation indicating that other, more local factors are likely to be important in determining lifespan within species. These findings suggest that, given predicted increases in global temperature, lifespan of ectotherms may be substantially shortened in the future.},

  abstract = {A central question at the interface of food-web and climate change research is how secondary production, or the formation of heterotroph biomass over time, will respond to rising temperatures. The metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) hypothesizes the temperature-invariance of secondary production, driven by matched and opposed forces that reduce biomass of heterotrophs while increasing their biomass turnover rate (production : biomass, or P:B) with warming. To test this prediction at the whole community level, we used a geothermal heat exchanger to experimentally warm a stream in southwest Iceland by 3.8\textdegree C for two years. We quantified invertebrate community biomass, production, and P : B in the experimental stream and a reference stream for one year prior to warming and two years during warming. As predicted, warming had a neutral effect on community production, but this result was not driven by opposing effects on community biomass and P:B. Instead, warming had a positive effect on both the biomass and production of larger-bodied, slower-growing taxa (e.g., larval black flies, dipteran predators, snails) and a negative effect on small-bodied taxa with relatively high growth rates (e.g., ostracods, larval chironomids). We attribute these divergent responses to differences in thermal preference between small- vs. large-bodied taxa. Although metabolic demand vs. resource supply must ultimately constrain community production, our results highlight the potential for idiosyncratic community responses to warming, driven by variation in thermal preference and body size within regional species pools.},

Warming is predicted to alter the structure of natural communities, but robust tests of such predictions require appropriate large-scale manipulations of intact, natural habitat that is open to dispersal processes via exchange with regional species pools. Here, we report results of a two-year whole-stream warming experiment that shifted invertebrate assemblage structure via unanticipated mechanisms, while still conforming to community-level metabolic theory. While warming by 3.8 \textdegree C decreased invertebrate abundance in the experimental stream by 60\% relative to a reference stream, total invertebrate biomass was unchanged. Associated shifts in invertebrate assemblage structure were driven by the arrival of new taxa and a higher proportion of large, warm-adapted species (i.e., snails and predatory dipterans) relative to smallbodied, cold-adapted taxa (e.g., chironomids and oligochaetes). Experimental warming consequently shifted assemblage size spectra in ways that were unexpected, but consistent with thermal optima of taxa in the regional species pool. Higher temperatures increased community-level energy demand, which was presumably satisfied by higher primary production after warming. Our experiment demonstrates how warming reassembles communities within the constraints of energy supply via regional exchange of species that differ in thermal physiological traits. Similar responses will likely mediate impacts of anthropogenic warming on biodiversity and ecosystem function across all ecological communities.},

Few studies, however, have experimentally assessed the net effect of warming on energy flux and food web dynamics in natural intact communities. Here, we test how warming affects energy flux and the trophic basis of production in a natural invertebrate food web by experimentally heating a stream reach in southwest Iceland by \textasciitilde 4\textdegree C for two years and comparing its response to an unheated reference stream. Previous results from this experiment showed that warming led to shifts in the structure of the invertebrate assemblage, with estimated increases in total metabolic demand but no change in annual secondary production. We hypothesized that elevated metabolic demand and invariant secondary production would combine to increase total consumption of organic matter in the food web, if diet composition did not change appreciably with warming. Dietary composition of primary consumers indeed varied little between streams and among years, with gut contents primarily consisting of diatoms (72.9\%) and amorphous detritus (19.5\%). Diatoms dominated the trophic basis of production of primary consumers in both study streams, contributing 79 \textendash{} 86\% to secondary production. Although warming increased the flux of filamentous algae within the food web, total resource consumption did not increase as predicted. The neutral net effect of warming on total energy flow through the food web was a result of taxon-level variation in responses to warming, a neutral effect on total invertebrate production, and strong trophic redundancy within the invertebrate assemblage. Thus, food webs characterized by a high degree of trophic redundancy may be more resistant to the effects of climate warming than those with more diverse and specialized consumers.},

However, such assessments require detailed long-term observations or ecosystem-level manipulations that allow for interactions among species and the potential for species dispersal and exchange with the regional species pool. We examined the effects of experimental whole-stream warming on a larval black fly assemblage in southwest Iceland. We used a paired-catchment design, in which we studied the warmed stream and a nearby reference stream for 1 year prior to warming and 2 years during warming and estimated population abundance, biomass, secondary production, and growth rates for larvae of three black fly species. Experimental warming by 3.8\textdegree C had contrasting effects on the three black fly species in the assemblage. The abundance, biomass, growth, and production of Prosimulium ursinum decreased in the experimental stream during the warming manipulation. Despite increasing in the reference stream, the abundance, biomass, and production of another species, Simulium vernum, decreased in the experimental stream during warming. In contrast, warming had an overall positive effect on Simulium vittatum. While warming had little effect on the growth of overwintering cohorts of S. vittatum, warming led to an additional cohort during the summer months and increased its abundance, biomass, and production. Overall, family-level production was enhanced by warming, despite variation in species-level responses. Our study illustrates that the effects of climate warming are likely to differ even among closely related species. Moreover, our study highlights the need for further investigation into the uneven effects of warming on individual species and how those variable effects influence food web dynamics and ecosystem function.},

  abstract = {Environmental factors regulate biodiversity through species sorting processes. Species distributions in communities affect ecosystem processes and environmental factors. These dynamics are determined by the properties (traits) of species in the community. The optimal temperatures for growth, the minimal amount of resource that sustains positive mass balance, and the amount of energy allocated to predator defenses are examples of such traits. Over time, the trait distributions in communities may change in response to environmental changes, which, in turn, changes the processes and consequently the structure of the system. The result of such processes is the focus of complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory. This paper gives an overview of how CAS theory can contribute to understanding the role of biodiversity on the ability of functional groups that make up the ecosystem to change their species compositions in response to changes in the environment. Any trait that requires investment of energy, mass, or time is subjected to a tradeoff for alternative use of this resource. Such interspecies tradeoff relationships can be used to make predictions about past environmental conditions, as well as the response of the properties of a group of species, e.g., total productivity and species distributions, to future changes in the environment. The trait based framework presented here makes explicit predictions regarding the relation between the environment, trait distributions, and ecosystem processes. Trait variance, a measure of the width of the distribution of traits in the community, is proportional to the rate at which species within functional groups can replace each other in response to environmental changes. This adaptive capacity is crucial for the ecosystem's ability to maintain certain processes under times of change. Examples of empirical tradeoffs are given as well as how to formalize them to use in the CAS framework.},

As this body of research grows, interpretation and extrapolation to other species and systems have been limited by a lack of theory. To address the need for theory for how warming affects species interactions, we used consumer-prey models and the metabolic theory of ecology to develop quantitative predictions for how systematic differences between the temperature dependence of heterotrophic and autotrophic population growth lead to temperature-dependent herbivory. We found that herbivore and plant abundances change with temperature in proportion to the ratio of autotrophic to heterotrophic metabolic temperature dependences. This result is consistent across five different formulations of consumer-prey models and over varying resource supply rates. Two models predict that temperature-dependent herbivory causes primary producer abundance to be independent of temperature. This finding contradicts simpler extensions of metabolic theory to abundance that ignore trophic interactions, and is consistent with patterns in terrestrial ecosystems. When applied to experimental data, the model explained 77\% and 66\% of the variation in phytoplankton and zooplankton abundances, respectively. We suggest that metabolic theory provides a foundation for understanding the effects of temperature change on multitrophic ecological communities.},

  abstract = {Environmental warming is predicted to rise dramatically over the next century, yet few studies have investigated its effects in natural, multi-species systems. We present data collated over an 8-year period from a catchment of geothermally heated streams in Iceland, which acts as a natural experiment on the effects of warming across different organisational levels and spatiotemporal scales. Body sizes and population biomasses of individual species responded strongly to temperature, with some providing evidence to support temperature\textendash size rules. Macroinvertebrate and meiofaunal community composition also changed dramatically across the thermal gradient. Interactions within the warm streams in particular were characterised by food chains linking algae to snails to the apex predator, brown trout. These chains were missing from the colder systems, where snails were replaced by much smaller herbivores and invertebrate omnivores were the top predators. Trout were also subsidised by terrestrial invertebrate prey, which could have an effect analogous to apparent competition within the aquatic prey assemblage. Top-down effects by snails on diatoms were stronger in the warmer streams, which could account for a shallowing of mass\textendash abundance slopes across the community. This may indicate reduced energy transfer efficiency from resources to consumers in the warmer systems and/or a change in predator\textendash prey mass ratios. All the ecosystem process rates investigated increased with temperature, but with differing thermal sensitivities, with important implications for overall ecosystem functioning (e.g. creating potential imbalances in elemental fluxes). Ecosystem respiration rose rapidly with temperature, leading to increased heterotrophy. There were also indications that food web stability may be lower in the warmer streams.},

Isolated laboratory and field experiments testing global change hypotheses have been criticized for being too small-scale and overly simplistic, whereas surveys are inferential and often confound temperature with other drivers. Research that utilizes natural thermal gradients offers a more promising approach and geothermal ecosystems in particular, which span a range of temperatures within a single biogeographic area, allow us to take the laboratory into nature rather than vice versa. By isolating temperature from other drivers, its ecological effects can be quantified without any loss of realism, and transient and equilibrial responses can be measured in the same system across scales that are not feasible using other empirical methods. Embedding manipulative experiments within geothermal gradients is an especially powerful approach, informing us to what extent small-scale experiments can predict the future behaviour of real ecosystems. Geothermal areas also act as sentinel systems by tracking responses of ecological networks to warming and helping to maintain ecosystem functioning in a changing landscape by providing sources of organisms that are preadapted to different climatic conditions. Here, we highlight the emerging use of geothermal systems in climate change research, identify novel research avenues, and assess their roles for catalysing our understanding of ecological and evolutionary responses to global warming.},

  abstract = {Global warming impacts virtually all biota and ecosystems. Many of these impacts are mediated through direct effects of temperature on individual vital rates. Yet how this translates from the individual to the population level is still poorly understood, hampering the assessment of global warming impacts on population structure and dynamics. Here, we study the effects of temperature on intraspecific competition and cannibalism and the population dynamical consequences in a size-structured fish population. We use a physiologically structured consumer-resource model in which we explicitly model the temperature dependencies of the consumer vital rates and the resource population growth rate. Our model predicts that increased temperature decreases resource density despite higher resource growth rates, reflecting stronger intraspecific competition among consumers. At a critical temperature, the consumer population dynamics destabilize and shift from a stable equilibrium to competition-driven generation cycles that are dominated by recruits. As a consequence, maximum age decreases and the proportion of younger and smaller-sized fish increases. These model predictions support the hypothesis of decreasing mean body sizes due to increased temperatures. We conclude that in size-structured fish populations, global warming may increase competition, favor smaller size classes, and induce regime shifts that destabilize population and community dynamics.},

  abstract = {Accumulating evidence suggests that the average body size of many organisms is declining in response to climate warming. This phenomenon has been suggested to represent a universal response to warming that may impose significant adverse effects on ecosystem functioning and services. However, we do not have a thorough understanding of why body sizes are commonly declining, and why some organisms show the opposite response. Because ectotherms constitute the vast majority of organism biomass and about 99\% of species worldwide, it is particularly important to understand how ectotherms respond to a warming climate. This review discusses the underlying physiological mechanisms of changes in ectotherm body size and addresses observed responses within a broad ecological context at different levels of organization, from individuals to communities, particularly in aquatic systems. Warming-induced responses in average body size are not only determined by changes in rates of individual growth and development, but also mediated through size-dependent feedbacks at the population level, as well as competitive and predatory interactions within the community. Emergent properties at higher organizational levels have already been observed in both experimental and natural systems. Various approaches will be required for enhancing our knowledge about the importance of such processes in natural systems. These include controlled semi-natural experiments and phylogenetic comparisons as well as statistical models of time-series data and theoretical models linking climate effects at the individual, population and community levels. Understanding causes of observed changes in organism body sizes and how these depend on the ecological context is essential for improving our predictions and the management of ecosystems in the face of a warming climate.},

We find that the TSR is expected to maintain consumer-resource biomass ratios and buffer the community from extinctions under warming. While our results are limited to conditions where organisms are below their thermal optimum, they hold under a range of realistic temperature-size responses and are robust to the type of functional response. Our analyses suggest that the widely observed TSR may reduce the impacts of warming on consumerresource systems.},

The temperature dependence of GPP is directly linked to photosynthetic physiology, but the response of GPP to warming over longer timescales could also be shaped by ecological and evolutionary processes that drive variation in community structure and functional trait distributions. Here, we show that selection on photosynthetic traits within and across taxa dampens the effects of temperature on GPP across a catchment of geothermally heated streams. Autotrophs from cold streams had higher photosynthetic rates and after accounting for differences in biomass among sites, biomass-specific GPP was independent of temperature in spite of a 20 \textdegree C thermal gradient. Our results suggest that temperature compensation of photosynthetic rates constrains the long-term temperature dependence of GPP, and highlights the importance of considering physiological, ecological and evolutionary mechanisms when predicting how ecosystem-level processes respond to warming.},

Whether long-term exposure to extreme environmental conditions drives adaptive shifts in body mass or metabolic rates remains an open question. We studied body size variation and variation in routine metabolic rates in locally adapted populations of extremophile fish (Poecilia mexicana) living in toxic, hydrogen sulfide\textendash rich springs and caves. We quantified size distributions and routine metabolic rates in wild-caught individuals from four habitat types. Compared with ancestral populations in nonsulfidic surface habitats, extremophile populations were characterized by significant reductions in body size. Despite elevated metabolic rates in cave fish, the body size reduction precipitated in significantly reduced energy demands in all extremophile populations. Laboratory experiments on common garden\textendash raised fish indicated that elevated routine metabolic rates in cave fish likely have a genetic basis. The results of this study indicate that adaptation to extreme environments directly impacts energy metabolism, with fish living in cave and sulfide spring environments expending less energy overall during routine metabolism.},

Warmed communities disproportionately lose top predators and herbivores, and become increasingly dominated by autotrophs and bacterivores. Changes in the relative distribution of organisms among trophically defined functional groups lead to differences in ecosystem function beyond those expected from temperature-dependent physiological rates. Diverse communities retain more species than depauperate ones, as predicted by the insurance hypothesis, which suggests that high biodiversity buffers against the effects of environmental variation because tolerant species are more likely to be found6,7. Studies of single trophic levels clearly show that warming can affect the distribution and abundance of species2,4,5, but complex responses generated in entire food webs greatly complicate inferences based on single functional groups.},

  abstract = {Local habitat size has been shown to influence colonization and extinction processes of species in patchy environments. However, species differ in body size, mobility, and trophic level, and may not respond in the same way to habitat size. Thus far, we have a limited understanding of how habitat size influences the structure of multitrophic communities and to what extent the effects may be generalizable over a broad geographic range. Here, we used water-filled bromeliads of different sizes as a natural model system to examine the effects of habitat size on the trophic structure of their inhabiting invertebrate communities. We collected composition and biomass data from 651 bromeliad communities from eight sites across Central and South America differing in environmental conditions, species pools, and the presence of large-bodied odonate predators. We found that trophic structure in the communities changed dramatically with changes in habitat (bromeliad) size. Detritivore : resource ratios showed a consistent negative relationship with habitat size across sites. In contrast, changes in predator : detritivore (prey) ratios depended on the presence of odonates as dominant predators in the regional pool. At sites without odonates, predator : detritivore biomass ratios decreased with increasing habitat size. At sites with odonates, we found odonates to be more frequently present in large than in small bromeliads, and predator : detritivore biomass ratios increased with increasing habitat size to the point where some trophic pyramids became inverted. Our results show that the distribution of biomass amongst food-web levels depends strongly on habitat size, largely irrespective of geographic differences in environmental conditions or detritivore species compositions. However, the presence of large-bodied predators in the regional species pool may fundamentally alter this relationship between habitat size and trophic structure. We conclude that taking into account the response and multitrophic effects of dominant, mobile species may be critical when predicting changes in community structure along a habitat-size gradient.},

  abstract = {Species interactions in food webs are usually recognized as dynamic, varying across species, space, and time because of biotic and abiotic drivers. Yet food webs also show emergent properties that appear consistent, such as a skewed frequency distribution of interaction strengths (many weak, few strong). Reconciling these two properties requires an understanding of the variation in pairwise interaction strengths and its underlying mechanisms. We estimated stream sculpin feeding rates in three seasons at nine sites in Oregon to examine variation in trophic interaction strengths both across and within predator\textendash prey pairs. Predator and prey densities, prey body mass, and abiotic factors were considered as putative drivers of within-pair variation over space and time. We hypothesized that consistently skewed interaction strength distributions could result if individual interaction strengths show relatively little variation, or alternatively, if interaction strengths vary but shift in ways that conserve their overall frequency distribution. Feeding rate distributions remained consistently and positively skewed across all sites and seasons. The mean coefficient of variation in feeding rates within each of 25 focal species pairs across surveys was less than half the mean coefficient of variation seen across species pairs within a survey. The rank order of feeding rates also remained conserved across streams, seasons and individual surveys. On average, feeding rates on each prey taxon nonetheless varied by a hundredfold, with some feeding rates showing more variation in space and others in time. In general, feeding rates increased with prey density and decreased with high stream flows and low water temperatures, although for nearly half of all species pairs, factors other than prey density explained the most variation. Our findings show that although individual interaction strengths exhibit considerable variation in space and time, they can nonetheless remain relatively consistent, and thus predictable, compared to the even larger variation that occurs across species pairs. These results highlight how the ecological scale of inference can strongly shape conclusions about interaction strength consistency and help reconcile how the skewed nature of interaction strength distributions can persist in highly dynamic food webs.},

For the river phytoplankton, low temperatures lowered EK values (onset of light saturation) and shifted photosynthesis in the water column from light dependence to temperature dependence. A photosynthesis-temperature-irradiance (P-T-E) model was developed to describe the varied temperature response of photosynthesis across the full range of limiting, saturating and inhibiting irradiances. The P-T-E model explained 74-95\% of the variation in photosynthesis for all size fractions (total community, {$>$}2 um fraction and {$<$}2 um fraction).

Snook that spent the majority of their time in downstream estuarine habitats displayed a diversity of resource usage across wide spatial scales, occupied a much larger trophic niche, and serve as a multidirectional vector of trophic coupling among marine, estuarine, and freshwater riverine habitats.

For eighty-seven percent of species, temperature explained less than 10\% of variation in mass, and for 79\% of species the correlation was not statistically significant. These results suggest that Bergmann's rule is not general and temperature is not a dominant driver of biogeographic variation in mass. Further understanding of size variation will require integrating multiple processes that influence size. The lack of dominant temperature forcing weakens the justification for the hypothesis that global warming could result in widespread decreases in body size.},

We gathered information on species and global warming from 143 studies for our meta-analyses. These analyses reveal a consistent temperature-related shift, or `fingerprint', in species ranging from molluscs to mammals and from grasses to trees. Indeed, more than 80\% of the species that show changes are shifting in the direction expected on the basis of known physiological constraints of species. Consequently, the balance of evidence from these studies strongly suggests that a significant impact of global warming is already discernible in animal and plant populations. The synergism of rapid temperature rise and other stresses, in particular habitat destruction, could easily disrupt the connectedness among species and lead to a reformulation of species communities, reflecting differential changes in species, and to numerous extirpations and possibly extinctions.},

We examined juvenile Oncorhynchus mykiss rearing, physical habitat, and resource phenologies in two Mediterranean coastal streams\textemdash one perennial, cool, and shaded and the other intermittent, seasonally warm, and sunny. We used a bioenergetic model to investigate the timing and magnitude of growth potential for drift-foraging O. mykiss during the spring and summer in both systems. Growth potential peaked at least 2 months earlier in the intermittent stream than in the perennial stream. By early summer (June), growth potential had declined in the intermittent stream, whereas growth rates were peaking in the perennial stream. However, the mid-July lipid content of juvenile O. mykiss in the intermittent stream was nearly twice that of fish in the perennial stream. By late summer (August), foraging profitability declined in both streams, as abiotic conditions in the intermittent stream approached lethal. In contrast, the perennial stream maintained suitable abiotic conditions even though the growth rate was low. We suggest that the divergent resource phenologies and seasonal mortality risks experienced by anadromous O. mykiss rearing in these streams could drive diversification of traits governing size, age, and timing of outmigration.},

However, this science has been dominated by studies of terrestrial vertebrates, spurring debate over the validity of such rules in other taxonomic groups. Here, relationships between maximum body size and latitude, temperature, and elevation were evaluated for 29 North American freshwater fish species. Bergmann's rule (i.e., that body size correlates positively with latitude and negatively with temperature) was observed in 38\% of species, converse Bergmann's rule (that body size correlates negatively with latitude and positively with temperature) was observed in 34\% of species, and 28\% of species showed no macroecological body size relationships. Most notably, every species that expressed Bergmann's rule was a cool- or cold-water species while every species that expressed converse Bergmann's rule was a warm-water species, highlighting how these patterns are likely connected to species thermal niches. This study contradicts previous research suggesting Bergmann's rule does not apply to freshwater fishes, and is congruent with an emerging paradigm of variable macroecological body size patterns in poikilotherms.},

Most coral reefs are moderately to severely degraded by local human activities such as fishing and pollution as well as global change, hence it is difficult to separate local from global effects. To this end, we surveyed coral reefs on uninhabited atolls in the northern Line Islands to provide a baseline of reef community structure, and on increasingly populated atolls to document changes associated with human activities. We found that top predators and reef-building organisms dominated unpopulated Kingman and Palmyra, while small planktivorous fishes and fleshy algae dominated the populated atolls of Tabuaeran and Kiritimati. Sharks and other top predators overwhelmed the fish assemblages on Kingman and Palmyra so that the biomass pyramid was inverted (top-heavy). In contrast, the biomass pyramid at Tabuaeran and Kiritimati exhibited the typical bottom-heavy pattern. Reefs without people exhibited less coral disease and greater coral recruitment relative to more inhabited reefs. Thus, protection from overfishing and pollution appears to increase the resilience of reef ecosystems to the effects of global warming.},

Here, we investigated the interactive effects of warming, enrichment, community size structure and TS responses on a three-species food chain using a temperature-dependent model with empirical parameterisation. We found that TS responses often increase community persistence, mainly by modifying consumer-resource size ratios and thereby altering interaction strengths and energetic efficiencies. However, the sign and magnitude of these effects vary with warming and enrichment levels, TS responses of constituent species, and community size structure. We predict that the consequences of TS responses are stronger in aquatic than in terrestrial ecosystems, especially when species show different TS responses. We conclude that considering the links between phenotypic plasticity, environmental drivers and species interactions is crucial to better predict global change impacts on ecosystem diversity and stability.},

  abstract = {Ecosystems in the Anthropocene face pressures from multiple, interacting forms of environmental change. These pressures, resulting from land use change, altered hydrologic regimes, and climate change, will likely change the synchrony of ecosystem processes as distinct components of ecosystems are impacted in different ways. However, discipline-specific definitions and ad hoc methods for identifying synchrony and asynchrony have limited broader synthesis of this concept among studies and across disciplines. Drawing on concepts from ecology, hydrology, geomorphology, and biogeochemistry, we offer a unifying definition of synchrony for ecosystem science and propose a classification framework for synchrony and asynchrony of ecosystem processes. This framework classifies the relationships among ecosystem processes according to five key aspects: (1) the focal variables or relationships representative of the ecosystem processes of interest, (2) the spatial and temporal domain of interest, (3) the structural attributes of drivers and focal processes, (4) consistency in the relationships over time, and (5) the degree of causality among focal processes. Using this classification framework, we identify and differentiate types of synchrony and asynchrony, thereby providing the basis for comparing among studies and across disciplines. We apply this classification framework to existing studies in the ecological, hydrologic, geomorphic, and biogeochemical literature and discuss potential analytical tools that can be used to quantify synchronous and asynchronous processes. Furthermore, we seek to promote understanding of how different types of synchrony or asynchrony may shift in response to ongoing environmental change by providing a universal definition and explicit types and drivers with this framework.},

Despite its fundamental importance in ecological systems, the concept is often treated as synonymous with unpredictability in community ecology, and studies tend to focus on single forms of stochasticity rather than taking a more holistic view. This has led to multiple narratives for how stochasticity mediates community dynamics. Here, we present a framework that describes how different forms of stochasticity (notably demographic and environmental stochasticity) combine to provide underlying and predictable structure in diverse communities. This framework builds on the deep ecological understanding of stochastic processes acting at individual and population levels and in modules of a few interacting species. We support our framework with a mathematical model that we use to synthesize key literature, demonstrating that stochasticity is more than simple uncertainty. Rather, stochasticity has profound and predictable effects on community dynamics that are critical for understanding how diversity is maintained. We propose next steps that ecologists might use to explore the role of stochasticity for structuring communities in theoretical and empirical systems, and thereby enhance our understanding of community dynamics.},

We tested the impact of elevated temperature on the top-down and bottom-up forces structuring experimental freshwater pond food webs in western Canada over 16 months. Experimental warming was crossed with treatments manipulating the presence of planktivorous fish and eutrophication through enhanced nutrient supply. We found that higher temperatures produced top-heavy food webs with lower biomass of benthic and pelagic producers, equivalent biomass of zooplankton, zoobenthos and pelagic bacteria, and more pelagic viruses. Eutrophication increased the biomass of all organisms studied, while fish had cascading positive effects on periphyton, phytoplankton and bacteria, and reduced biomass of invertebrates. Surprisingly, virus biomass was reduced in the presence of fish, suggesting the possibility for complex mechanisms of top-down control of the lytic cycle. Warming reduced the effects of eutrophication on periphyton, and magnified the already strong effects of fish on phytoplankton and bacteria. Warming, fish and nutrients all increased whole-system rates of net production despite their distinct impacts on the distribution of biomass between producers and consumers, plankton and benthos, and microbes and macrobes. Our results indicate that warming exerts a host of indirect effects on aquatic food webs mediated through shifts in the magnitudes of top-down and bottom-up forcing.},

To test this hypothesis, we performed traditional and phylogenetic meta-analyses of the association between annual estimates of directional selection on body size from wild populations and annual mean temperatures from 39 longitudinal studies. We found no evidence that warmer environments were associated with selection for smaller size. Instead, selection consistently favoured larger individuals, and was invariant to temperature. These patterns were similar in ectotherms and endotherms. An analysis using year rather than temperature revealed similar patterns, suggesting no evidence that selection has changed over time, and also indicating that the lack of association with annual temperature was not an artefact of choosing an erroneous time window for aggregating the temperature data. Although phenotypic trends in size will be driven by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, our results suggest little evidence for a necessary ingredient\textemdash negative directional selection\textemdash for declines in body size to be considered an adaptive evolutionary response to changing selection pressures.},

The mechanisms behind this rule are still debated, and it is not clear whether Bergmann's rule can be extended to predict the effects of climate change through time. We reviewed the primary literature for evidence (i) of a decrease in body size in response to climate warming, (ii) that changing body size is an adaptive response and (iii) that these responses are evolutionary or plastic. We found weak evidence for changes in body size through time as predicted by Bergmann's rule. Only three studies investigated the adaptive nature of these size decreases. Of these, none reported evidence of selection for smaller size or of a genetic basis for the size change, suggesting that size decreases could be due to nonadaptive plasticity in response to changing environmental conditions. More studies are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn about the underlying causes of these changes in body size in response to a warming climate.},

A comparison of systems formed over a range of physical conditions may help to evaluate the role of physical factors in determining community structure. We investigated abiotic determinants of species richness, abundance, biomass, diversity and evenness using a series of erosional rock pools on the northern coast of Jamaica. Aquatic invertebrate community data were collected from 1989 to 1997, along with repeated measurements of physical variables, including descriptors of pool conditions, morphometric characteristics and other derived measures to a total of 17 variables. These variables were used to evaluate a range of regression models, from simple to complex, which explained the observed biodiversity. Simple regression models were occasionally significant but explained little variance. Multiple regression models (using a forward stepwise approach) significantly increased the explained variance of these biodiversity models. Diversity models that emphasized species richness (rather than dominance or evenness) of the community, were preferred. These results suggest that much of the observed species richness/diversity is determined by abiotic pool conditions and represents an accumulation of tolerant species, either directly or indirectly (i.e. modulated by biotic interactions). However, regression models attempting to predict abundance/biomass based on abiotic variables explained less variance than did those predicting richness/diversity. This may indicate that biotic factors within pools at population or community levels are controlling species densities.},

Although pyramids are visually intuitive, explicitly linking them to size spectra connects pyramids to metabolic and size-based theory, and illuminates size-based constraints on pyramid shape. We show that bottom-heavy pyramids should predominate in the real world, whereas top-heavy pyramids indicate overestimation of predator abundance or energy subsidies. Making the link to ecological pyramids establishes size spectra as a central concept in ecosystem ecology, and provides a powerful framework both for understanding baseline expectations of community structure and for evaluating future scenarios under climate change and exploitation.},

  abstract = {Microbial food web organisms are at the base of the functioning of pelagic ecosystems and support the whole marine food web. They are very reactive to environmental changes and their interactions are modified in response to different productive periods such as phytoplankton bloom and non-bloom as well as contrasted climatic years. To study ecological associations, identify potential interactions between microorganisms and study the structure of the microbial food web in coastal waters, a weekly monitoring was carried out in the Thau Lagoon on the French Mediterranean coast. The monitoring lasted from winter to late spring during two contrasting climatic years, a typical Mediterranean (2015) and a year with an extreme warm winter (2016). Correlation networks comprising 110 groups/taxa/species were constructed to characterize potential possible interactions between the microorganisms during bloom and non-bloom periods. Complex correlation networks during the bloom and dominated by negative intraguild correlations and positive correlations of phytoplankton with bacteria. Such pattern can be interpreted as a dominance of competition and mutualism. In contrast, correlation networks during the non-bloom period were less complex and mostly dominated by tintinnids associations with bacteria mostly referring to potential feeding on bacteria, which suggests a shift of biomass transfer from phytoplankton-dominated food webs during bloom to more bacterioplankton-based food webs during non-bloom. Inter-annual climatic conditions significantly modified the structure of microbial food webs. The warmer year favored relationships among smaller group/taxa/species at the expense of large phytoplankton and ciliates, possibly due to an intensification of the trophic cascade with a potential shift in energy circulation through microbial food web. Our study compares a typical Mediterranean spring with another mimicking the prospected intensification of global warming; if such consideration holds true, the dominance of future coastal marine ecosystems will be shifted from the highly productive herbivorous food web to the less productive microbial food web.},

While ecologists have long sought to identify the determinants of the trophic height of food webs (food chain length), it is somewhat surprising how little research effort is invested in understanding changes among other food web properties across environmental conditions. Here we theoretically and empirically show how a suite of fundamental macroscopic food web structures respond, in concert, to changes in habitat accessibility using post-glacial lakes as model ecosystems. We argue that as resource accessibility increases in coupled food webs, food chain length contracts (that is, reduced predator trophic position), habitat coupling expands (that is, increasingly coupled macrohabitats) and biomass pyramid structure becomes more top heavy. Our results further support an emerging theoretical view of flexible food webs that provides a foundation for generally understanding ecosystem responses to changing environmental conditions.},

Despite extensive research looking at the factors underlying foraging interactions, there remains ongoing controversy about how temperature and body size control the functional response parameters space clearance (or attack) rate and handling time. Here, we investigate the effects of temperature, consumer mass, and resource mass using the largest compilation of functional responses yet assembled. This compilation contains 2,083 functional response curves covering a wide range of foragers and prey types, environmental conditions, and habitats. After accounting for experimental arena size, dimensionality of the foraging interaction, and consumer taxon, we find that both space clearance rate and handling time are optimized at intermediate temperatures (a unimodal rather than monotonic response), suggesting that the response to global climate change depends on the location of the consumer's current temperature relative to the optimum. We further confirm that functional responses are higher and steeper for large consumers and small resources, and models using consumer and resource masses separately outperformed models using consumer:resource mass ratios, suggesting that consumer and resource body mass act independently to set interaction strengths. Lastly, we show that the extent to which foraging is affected by temperature or mass depends on the taxonomic identity of the consumer and the dimensionality of the consumer\textendash resource interaction. We thus argue that although overall body size and temperature effects can be identified, they are not universal, and therefore food web and community modeling approaches could be improved by considering taxonomic identity along with body size and unimodal temperature effects.},

In particular, it is unclear if expected body size shrinkage in response to warming, observed at the interspecific level, can be used to infer similar size shifts within species. In this study, we compare warming effects on interspecific (relative species abundance) versus intraspecific (relative stage abundance) size structure of competing consumers by analyzing stage-structured bioenergetic food web models consisting of one or two consumer species and two resources, parameterized for pelagic plankton. Varying composition and temperature and body size dependencies in these models, we predicted interspecific versus intraspecific size structure across temperature. We found that warming shifted community size structure toward dominance of smaller species, in line with empirical evidence summarized in our review of 136 literature studies. However, this result emerged only given a size\textendash temperature interaction favoring small over large individuals in warm environments. In contrast, the same mechanism caused an intraspecific shift toward dominance of larger (adult) stages, reconciling disparate observations of size responses within and across zooplankton species in the literature. As the empirical evidence for warming-driven stage shifts is scarce and equivocal, we call for more experimental studies on intraspecific size changes with warming. Understanding the global warming impacts on animal communities requires that we consider and quantify the relative importance of mechanisms concurrently shaping size distributions within and among species.},

In size-structured populations, larger-bodied individuals do better during winter as they have larger energy reserves to buffer starvation periods. In contrast, smaller-bodied individuals do better under growing conditions, as they have lower maintenance costs. We study how the interplay between size-dependent life-history processes and seasonal changes in temperature and food availability shape the long-term dynamics of a size-structured consumer population and its unstructured resource. We show that the size dependence of maintenance requirements translates into a minimum body size that is needed for surviving starvation when consumers can adapt only to a limited extent to the low food densities in winter. This size threshold can lead to population extinction because adult individuals suffer only a little during winter and hence produce large numbers of offspring. Due to population feedback on the resource and intense intra-cohort competition, newborn consumers then fail to reach the size threshold for survival. Under these conditions, small numbers of individuals can survive, increase in density, and build up a population, which will subsequently go extinct due to its feedback on the resource. High juvenile mortality may prevent this ecological suicide from occurring, as it releases resource competition among newborns and speeds up their growth. In size-structured populations, annual fluctuations in temperature and food availability may thus lead to a conflict between individual fitness and population persistence.},

  abstract = {Climate change studies have long focused on effects of increasing temperatures, often without considering other simultaneously occurring environmental changes, such as browning of waters. Resolving how the combination of warming and browning of aquatic ecosystems affects fish biomass production is essential for future ecosystem functioning, fisheries, and food security. In this study, we analyzed individual- and population-level fish data from 52 temperate and boreal lakes in Northern Europe, covering large gradients in water temperature and color (absorbance, 420 nm). We show that fish (Eurasian perch, Perca fluviatilis) biomass production decreased with both high water temperatures and brown water color, being lowest in warm and brown lakes. However, while both high temperature and brown water decreased fish biomass production, the mechanisms behind the decrease differed: temperature affected the fish biomass production mainly through a decrease in population standing stock biomass, and through shifts in size- and age-distributions toward a higher proportion of young and small individuals in warm lakes; brown water color, on the other hand, mainly influenced fish biomass production through negative effects on individual body growth and length-at-age. In addition to these findings, we observed that the effects of temperature and brown water color on individual-level processes varied over ontogeny. Body growth only responded positively to higher temperatures among young perch, and brown water color had a stronger negative effect on body growth of old than on young individuals. Thus, to better understand and predict future fish biomass production, it is necessary to integrate both individual- and population-level responses and to acknowledge within-species variation. Our results suggest that global climate change, leading to browner and warmer waters, may negatively affect fish biomass production, and this effect may be stronger than caused by increased temperature or water color alone.},

General mathematical models of community dynamics are often too simplistic to accurately describe this response, partly to retain mathematical tractability and partly for the lack of biologically pleasing functions representing the model/environment interface. We address these problems of tractability and plausibility in community/environment models by incorporating the Boltzmann factor (temperature dependence) in a bioenergetic consumer-resource framework. Our analysis leads to three predictions for the response of consumer-resource systems to increasing mean temperature (warming). First, mathematical extinctions do not occur with warming; however, stable systems may transition into an unstable (cycling) state. Second, there is a decrease in the biomass density of resources with warming. The biomass density of consumers may increase or decrease depending on their proximity to the feasibility (extinction) boundary. Third, consumer biomass density is more sensitive to warming than resource biomass density (with some exceptions). These predictions are in line with many current observations and experiments. The model presented and analyzed here provides an advancement in the testing framework for global change scenarios and hypotheses of latitudinal and elevational species distributions.},

Several experimental studies have shown that tundra plants and ecosystems can respond strongly to environmental change, including warming; however, most studies were limited to a single location and were of short duration and based on a variety of experimental designs. In addition, comparisons among studies are difficult because a variety of techniques have been used to achieve experimental warming and different measurements have been used to assess responses. We used metaanalysis on plant community measurements from standardized warming experiments at 11 locations across the tundra biome involved in the International Tundra Experiment. The passive warming treatment increased plant-level air temperature by 1-3\textdegree C, which is in the range of predicted and observed warming for tundra regions. Responses were rapid and detected in whole plant communities after only two growing seasons. Overall, warming increased height and cover of deciduous shrubs and graminoids, decreased cover of mosses and lichens, and decreased species diversity and evenness. These results predict that warming will cause a decline in biodiversity across a wide variety of tundra, at least in the short term. They also provide rigorous experimental evidence that recently observed increases in shrub cover in many tundra regions are in response to climate warming. These changes have important implications for processes and interactions within tundra ecosystems and between tundra and the atmosphere.},

We evaluate the possibility that a few principal drivers underpin network-level responses to climate change, and that these drivers can be studied to develop a more coherent theoretical framework than is currently provided by phenomenological approaches. For instance, warming will elevate individual ectotherm metabolic rates, and direct and indirect effects of changes in atmospheric conditions are expected to alter the stoichiometry of interactions between primary consumers and basal resources; these effects are general and pervasive, and will permeate through the entire networks that they affect. In addition, changes in the density and viscosity of aqueous media could alter interactions among very small organisms and disrupt the pycnoclines that currently compartmentalize many aquatic networks in time and space. We identify a range of approaches and potential model systems that are particularly well suited to network-level studies within the context of climate change. We also highlight potentially fruitful areas of research with a view to improving our predictive power regarding climate change impacts on networks. We focus throughout on mechanistic approaches rooted in first principles that demonstrate potential for application across a wide range of taxa and systems.},

However, quantitatively disentangling direct and indirect relationships in networks remains a formidable task. Here, we present a framework, called iDIRECT (Inference of Direct and Indirect Relationships with Effective Copula-based Transitivity), for quantitatively inferring direct dependencies in association networks. Using copula-based transitivity, iDIRECT eliminates/ameliorates several challenging mathematical problems, including ill-conditioning, self-looping, and interaction strength overflow. With simulation data as benchmark examples, iDIRECT showed high prediction accuracies. Application of iDIRECT to reconstruct gene regulatory networks in               Escherichia coli               also revealed considerably higher prediction power than the best-performing approaches in the DREAM5~(Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods project, \#5) Network Inference Challenge. In addition, applying iDIRECT to highly diverse grassland soil microbial communities in response to climate warming showed that the iDIRECT-processed networks were significantly different from the original networks, with considerably fewer nodes, links, and connectivity, but higher relative modularity. Further analysis revealed that the iDIRECT-processed network was more complex under warming than the control and more robust to both random and target species removal (               P               {$<$} 0.001). As a general approach, iDIRECT has great advantages for network inference, and it should be widely applicable to infer direct relationships in association networks across diverse disciplines in science and engineering.},

  abstract = {Aim The difficulty in predicting responses to press perturbation is largely due to the tangled nature of indirect interactions in natural ecological networks. Although previous theories have paved the way for evaluating net interaction effects by incorporating direct and indirect effects related to press perturbation, there are still critical knowledge gaps regarding the relationships between net interaction effects and network topologies because of lack of comparable interaction strengths across ecosystems. Location Global. Time period 1984\textendash 2020. Major taxa studied Aquatic organisms. Methods We compiled a global dataset of food webs with a consistent modelling method to estimate direct interaction strength. We revealed the general patterns of net interaction effects and their associations with network topologies by applying matrix theory and network analysis. Results In the examined food webs, the net (absolute) interaction strengths followed a right-skewed pattern (many weak and few strong net strengths) and were significantly associated with various network- and species-level topological structures. Indirect effects led to the emergence of net mutualism and competition effects rather than simply net predator\textendash prey interaction effects, and might play an important role in changing signs from direct to net interaction effects in species-rich and highly connected food webs and for species with a large number of interaction partners. Main conclusions Our results highlight the ecological significance and necessity of linking net interaction effects with network topologies, which can help target ecosystems and species that are more vulnerable to sustained perturbation in the application of conservation and biodiversity management.},

  abstract = {"Plausible" consumer-resource models, based on energetic reasoning and allometric empiricism, are formulated and their dynamics investigated. Most of the parameters in these models are determined by the body sizes and metabolic categories (endotherm, vertebrate ectotherm, invertebrate ectotherm, or plant) of the populations in question. The remaining parameters have clear biological meanings. The intent of these models is to provide maximum realism from minimum data when needed because of constraints of time or of resources for empirical research. The models also demonstrate the influence of physiological power and body size on consumer-resource dynamics. For a given metabolic type, we define ecological scope as the ratio of maximal ingestion rate to respiration rate. Invertebrate ectotherms have greater ecological scope than do vertebrate ectotherms, which have greater scope than do endotherms. Greater ecological scope implies ability to subsist on scarcer resources and a tendency to more stable dynamics. Changes in dynamics associated with increased resource carrying capacity K (the "paradox of enrichment") are investigated. Robust limit cycles (sustained oscillations) require a Type III functional response, but even in this case the cycles quickly "implode" (with respect to changes in K) to extremely small densities if the resource-consumer body mass ratio is too high. Estimates are given for resource-consumer body mass ratios that permit robust limit cycles, and some pertinent data are discussed. An analytic expression for the periods of limit cycles is derived. In terms of body mass, the periods scale as (consumer body mass)1/8 (resource body mass)1/8.},

  abstract = {Aim General geographical patterns of insect body size are still a matter of considerable debate, mainly because the annual number of generations (voltinism) and its relationship with body size have largely been ignored. We present the first analyses of voltinism and body size of insect assemblages at a continental scale using lepidopteran and odonate species. We hypothesize that voltinism is strongly driven by environmental conditions and constrains body size on macroecological scales. Location Europe. Methods We compiled the distribution, voltinism and body size of 943 lepidopteran and odonate species within a 50 km \texttimes{} 50 km grid system, thereby presenting a novel method for estimating the body volume of species from digital images. Regressions and structural equation modelling were applied to distinguish the effects of temperature, productivity and season length on mean voltinism and body size within grid cells. We accounted for spatial autocorrelation with autoregressive models and analysed the possible effect of species richness and intraspecific variability. Results Voltinism consistently decreased with latitude for both lepidopterans (r2 = 0.76) and odonates (r2 = 0.86), with species having on average fewer generations per year in northern Europe and more generations per year in southern Europe. The effects of temperature, productivity and season length on body size contrasted in sign between lepidopterans and odonates, leading to opposing geographical patterns across Europe. Main conclusions Voltinism in insect assemblages is strongly driven by environmental temperature, and trade-offs between voltinism and body size influence the occurrence of species at macroecological scales. Insects with the ability to extend their generation time over multiple years can overcome this constraint, allowing for a relatively large body size in cold areas. Our results furthermore support the idea that body sizes of terrestrial and aquatic insects form contrasting geographical patterns because they are differently affected by temperature and resource constraints.},

  abstract = {Climate change affects ecological communities through its impact on the physiological performance of individuals. However, the population dynamic of species well inside their thermal niche is also determined by competitors, prey and predators, in addition to being influenced by temperature changes. We use a trait-based food-web model to examine how the interplay between the direct physiological effects from temperature and the indirect effects due to changing interactions between populations shapes the ecological consequences of climate change for populations and for entire communities. Our simulations illustrate how isolated communities deteriorate as populations go extinct when the environment moves outside the species' thermal niches. High-trophic-level species are most vulnerable, while the ecosystem function of lower trophic levels is less impacted. Open communities can compensate for the loss of ecosystem function by invasions of new species. Individual populations show complex responses largely uncorrelated with the direct impact of temperature change on physiology. Such complex responses are particularly evident during extinction and invasion events of other species, where climatically well-adapted species may be brought to extinction by the changed food-web topology. Our results highlight that the impact of climate change on specific populations is largely unpredictable, and apparently well-adapted species may be severely impacted.},
